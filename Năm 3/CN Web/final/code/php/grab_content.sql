It is a chance for Vietnamese children to honour their parents and try to help the lost souls of their ancestors find their way back to earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActivities during the month include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a paper-mache form of material items such as clothes, gold, bank notes and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>In Hanoi</strong>, during the Vu Lan holiday, Hang Ma Street selling votive paper products are the busiest. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the beginning of the 7th month of the lunar calendar, Thu, came to Hang Ma Street where sells votive paper products in order to buy necessary offerings for her family’s Vu Lan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/25/09/vangma1_23081020100825092613201008250928092010082509285520100825093049.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Votive paper products sold out on Hang Ma street (Photo by T. Nguyen)</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to meet various demands of customers, the whole of Hang Ma street displays and sells many kinds of votive paper products ranging from traditional items such as ao tu than (4-part dress), coi trau (Betel chewing kit), non la (palm-leaf conial hat) or horse drawn carts to modern items such as cars, motorbikes, fridges or televisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, votive paper multi-floor houses were made in a very sophisticated manner. A good 3 floor house cost about VND180,000-250,000 ($9.1-12.7). A good quality paper car or motorbike sells for about VND80,000-100,000 ($4.1-5.1). A television or fridge might sell for about VND50,000 ($2.5).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA standard offerings kit could cost a total of nearly VND1.2 million ($61). However, according to sellers here, many rich customers were willing to spend dozens of millions of dong on very expensive kits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA shop owner on Hang Ma Street shared that they had sold out of expensive offerings since the 14th of the month. Now they have only normal offerings left. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>In Ho Chi Minh City</strong>, goods for the festival varied but the customer demand was not remarkable. In big markets, the number of sellers seemed to be more than buyers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/25/09/vu-lan-tphcm-1201008250928092010082509285520100825093049.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Many customers go to enjoy vegetarian food during Vu Lan</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nguyen Thi Hien, selling vegetarian food said the prices and demand for vegetarian food during this festival were not so high. She presumed that heavy rains made many people not want to go to markets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn agent selling votive paper products in Binh Tay market, Ho Chi Minh City said, “The number of customers had increased for this half month but they did not buy much. We expected that they would have many customers buying large offerings kits this year. We did not know that our sales result would turn out like this.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, many special programmes for the festival held in restaurants and at tourism sites attracted quite a lot of visitors. Suoi Tien Tourism site received over 1,000 monks from Ho Chi Minh City and its neighbouring provinces, cities as well as thousands of tourists and locals on the opening ceremony of the festival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, many restaurants offering vegetarian food had lured customers as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThien, living in District 3 said, “On this occasion I want to take my parents to a good restaurant to enjoy vegetarian dishes. They often prepare this kind of food at home but on this day I want them to have time to take rest.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a vegetarian restaurant owner on Road 3/3, District 10, many families here are tending to welcome the festival at vegetarian restaurants because it’s not easy to prepare vegetarian dishes at home. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>In Hue City</strong>, many young people were excited to visit pagodas, the gravestones of their ancestors or making vegetarian food at home.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:23', '2010-12-26 10:23:23'),

The colorful exterior is matched by the colorful robes the priests wear during worship. (Photos by GINA C. MENESES)</em></p>\r\n<p>It is HCMC or Ho Chi Minh City now, but the Vietnamese still call it Saigon and call themselves Saigonese.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaigon has been one of the places in my must-visit list and it was surprising that not too many people share that sentiment about this country made famous by a war. It took a year to gather friends who would be willing to go to an adventure, as most friends would rather spend on a trip of pleasure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinus the misadventures, Saigon didn’t disappoint us, and even surprised us with sights and insights you do not find anywhere else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCao Dai Temple<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout three hours from Saigon is the Tay Ninh Holy See, or Cao Dai Temple, the center of the Cao Dai Religion. This religion was established in Vietnam in 1926 and now counts two to three million followers scattered in Vietnam, Cambodia, France, and US.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Temple has nine levels, representing the nine steps to heaven. Black, scaly dragons wrap the pink columns supporting the ceiling painted like a summer sky. These columns mark the beginning and end of each level, and served as the boundary for how far the tourists could go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of the hall is the altar which looks like a globe with an eye. Elders offered incense here. Tourists are not allowed to walk or even stand, much less shoot a picture, at the middle section of the hall, even outside worship hours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCu Chi Tunnel<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cu Chi Tunnel was Vietnam’s secret weapon against the Americans. It was a 250- kilometer underground tunnel network that stretched from Saigon to the Cambodian border. The Cu Chi tunnels served as hospitals, command centers, living areas, kitchen, and supplies storage during the Vietnam War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cu Chi Tunnel is not for everyone. First of all, you enter the tunnel crouched and never get a chance to stand straight until you get out. There are lamps at ankle level; but they are few and far between, and their light is faint. Body heat and the earth’s heat combine to make it very warm inside, even though it was raining outside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter 25 meters, tourists decide whether to take the exit or go on. The next exit, which also wraps up the tour, is at 100 meters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next 75 meters was not for the unfit. There was a four-foot drop. And then an ascent, where the ceiling is too low, you have to crawl to move on. Past that drop and climb are long stretches of darkness, and the next light you see is that of the exit, 100 meters from the entrance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur guide says that during the Vietnam War, there wasn’t a single light source in the tunnel. The Vietnamese soldiers brought oil lamps with them whenever they go inside. Gee, I worried about my own weight, and those soldiers had to carry an oil lamp and a rifle, and breathe the soot and endure more heat from the oil lamp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tunnels must have been more punishing for the bigger-built Americans whose shoulders alone could easily span the original width of the Tunnels. Perhaps those who were too big for the Tunnels might have been better off. The labyrinthine Cu Chi Tunnels, is easily a booby trap for the unfamiliar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWar Museum<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tour takes you through six buildings that house tanks, planes, bombs, photos, and other war memorabilia. Since it wasn’t too easy to understand what the guide was saying, my friend, Tonette Alegria and I decided to go around by ourselves and shoot photos as much as the time allowed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMotorcycles by the millions<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriends and websites were not kidding with their warning on motorcycles. We saw for ourselves how motorcycles outnumbered all other forms of transportation in Saigon. It was a common sight to see motorcycles taking up two out of three lanes of the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to our guide, there are four million motorcycles in Saigon, a city of eight million people. We also learned that there was no need for a license if the motorcycle is less than 50 cc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReunification palace<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso called Independence Palace, the tour here was the quickest we did, and the least we enjoyed. Imagine going through dozens of rooms located in five floors, in only two hours. I wish we had more time to take in the rooms and let the sense of history sink in. There was a map room that detailed the contingencies from various countries, yes, including the Philippines. The telegraph room gave the feeling of time travel, in this era of mobile phones. Like our Malacañang, the cavernous reception rooms were nothing short of awesome displays of the finest furniture and art. The tank outside is a replica of the tank that crashed through its gates in 1975, marking the end of the Vietnam War, and paving the way for the reunification of North and South Vietnam. Every corner, every item has a share in the history of Vietnam, but there was just too little time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne-million dollar dinner with a view<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were just three of us, and the bill reached one million dollars. Good thing the currency was Vietnamese dollar, and the exchange rate was 19,000 to a US dollar. But then again, a treat at any currency is still a treat, and it was courtesy of our good friend Eden Fanlo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat dinner was at Rex Hotel, which has earned its place in Vietnamese history for its having been the site of media briefings during the war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe restaurant was recommended to us not so much for the food but for its location. We were asking about the best place to take a top shot of an intersection with the most number of motorcycles. The Sheraton and the Caravelle, both historic landmarks, too, were crossed out of our list, because their windows are not meant to be opened, and the rooftops, too high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, we didn’t get as many motorcycles as those that crowded around us the day before, but the plaza and the People’s Committee Building more than made up for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotre Dame Cathedral<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe blue skies and feathery clouds made our last morning all the more beautiful, and they were a perfect backdrop for the century-old Notre Dame Cathedral. Like some of the old churches in Manila, part of its walls and floors hold marble slabs etched with names of the dearly departed. Devotees lighting up candles was a common sight, too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what I would probably remember most was, it was at the Notre Dame Cathedral where we got ‘lost.’ We were here when we felt the urge to try the local Jollibee. It took three cabs before we got a ride. The first two drivers didn’t know. The third cab driver did his best, even calling the office to ask for directions. One hour and so many turns later, we were still nowhere near the fast food restaurant. We decided to return to the hotel and google “Jollibee Saigon.” We found six outlets. Armed with that list, we showed it to the front desk to ask help in choosing the nearest one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPost Office<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore this trip, I never thought that a post office could be a tourist attraction. It could be that souvenirs are sold here in air conditioned comfort, at the same prices they are sold at the Binh Tay Market. But perhaps it is also the beautiful interior and exterior of the building.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Are you an American?”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was an American family in our group who were touring a friend from the US. The patriarch was a Vietnam vet who stayed after the war was over, and started a family in Saigon. After a few hours that we have been together in the tour, the more gregarious daughter asked, in quick succession: “Are you an American? Were you born in America?” They were surprised to learn that English is the medium of instruction in the Philippines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSave for the US dollar, Americana was conspicuously missing in Vietnam. Very few understand English, and much fewer are able to speak it. There was no McDonald’s at all. Quick meals are available from ambulant vendors selling coconut juice, boiled peanuts, boiled egg, sliced fruits, ripe banana, and the like. Hot noodle soup is sold from what looks like the corner carinderia back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also remember missing the sunset. It was summer; but for four days, daylight would fade to mark the end of the day and that was it. A far cry from the dramatic sunsets almost anywhere in the Philippines. Hmm, it is really time to go home.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:24', '2010-12-26 10:23:24'),

It also lit the Thu Bon River, where the small fishing boats had just pulled up to shore. It was 5:30 a.m. as I approached the central marketplace, where I experienced the tastes, sounds, and energy—the real life of the local people. Vietnam’s gem-city of Hoi An was just awakening.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Greeting the Day</strong></p>\r\n<p>Women in conical straw hats with bright smiles balanced long poles over their shoulders. Their poles were heavy with hanging baskets stuffed with vegetables, fish, and even live geese, as they scurried along the dirt pathways. The endless array of baskets filled with herbs covered the ground in a blanket of greenery, while pungent fish and spice aromas permeated the air.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI stopped and tasted a small, spiny chom chom, or rambuten, similar in sweetness to a lychee, proffered by an old woman sitting cross-legged on the ground surrounded by exotic fruits.</p>\r\n<p>By 6:30 a.m., all was quiet as the fishing boats pulled out and the larger vessels, piled with motorbikes, entered the shoreline. Before the town fully awoke, I strolled along Bach Dang Street in view of the Japanese Covered Bridge (circa 1593), replete with a roof and temple. According to legend, the bridge began the Year of the Monkey and was completed in the Year of the Dog, so forms of each of these animals are on opposite sides to guard the bridge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>To Market, to Market</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHoi An is a shopping mecca, with tailor shops lining the narrow streets from Tran Hang Dao Street to Le Loi, and everywhere in between. Some people brought photos and designs of clothes to be made, since custom-made clothing is so inexpensive and can be ready within 24 hours or less.</p>\r\n<p>The city showcases not only clothing shops but also an array of art galleries, cafés, and high-quality restaurants. Ly Café 22, run by chef/owner Miss Ly, serves unforgettable fried rice, which has lingered on my taste buds since. Another favorite local dish, White Rose, consists of steamed shrimp wrapped like a flower in rice paper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther dishes that I enjoyed were Cau Lau, a thick, rice noodle soup topped with sprouts and pork; and Com Ga, a rice dish with steamed chicken and fresh herbs. The Cargo Club, a French-style patisserie, was a place where I ruminated over a foamy latté and luscious pastry. For ale lovers, most beers are 50 cents or $10,000 dongs.<br />\r\nNational Treasures. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site situated in Central Vietnam, Hoi An was once a popular trading port as early as the 17th century. Vestiges of Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and French cultures are still evident amid the colorful architecture of this relatively calm enclave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI caught a glimpse of the city at a good time, devoid of racing motorbikes, which are restricted several days and hours a week. What a relief, since the country has about 24 million of these bikes zooming throughout its cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHoi An was just one stop on my 10-day, small-group journey of the historic sites of Vietnam from Hanoi to Saigon. The tour was organized by eco- and socially-conscious Travel Indochina, experts in Asian travel exploring the history, culture, natural beauty, and people of this area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur next venture was a four-hour drive along the Hai Van Pass on the National Highway to another UNESCO Site, Hue, once the capital during the Ngugen dynasty in the 19th century. We traveled along the scenic Pacific coastline reminiscent of California’s Big Sur, with bold mountain ranges wrapping around the waters. The difference, however, was the farmlands riddled with rice paddies, accented by colorful lotus flowers, and boys on buffalos posing along the roadside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe made a stop 30 minutes from Hoi An, just south of Danang, at the towering Marble Mountains, where we climbed some 200 steps up a stone and marble stairway (a bit slippery going down). A larger-than-life Buddha and female Buddha (the Goddess of Mercy) awaited us amid the strong scent of incense that filled the decorated pagodas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hidden cave there (once a hospital for the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War) was the most memorable, with a cascade of light shooting through the top opening that created a surreal, mystical effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hue Highlights</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe finally arrived at Hue, the sun glistening on the Perfume River, which got its name from the scent of wild ginger blowing in from the forested area nearby.</p>\r\n<table width="200" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="left">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="300" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="225" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/350.0.1.0.16777215.0.stories.large.2010.08.26.Stonestatues.JPG" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><em>SILENT SENTINELS: Stone statues of soldiers stand guard at the Tomb of Khai Dinh in Hue.</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="300" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="225" border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/350.0.1.0.16777215.0.stories.large.2010.08.26.WomanMarket.JPG" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><em>QUIETUDE: A woman briefly relaxes at a market in Hoi An.</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>This city of pagodas, palaces, tombs, and 130 Buddhist temples survived destruction from conflicts with the French and the United States. The moated citadel, built in 1804, has maintained its beauty despite the ravages of war.</p>\r\n<p>We walked through the ceremonial halls, garden areas, and in front of the Forbidden City, once reserved for the privacy of the emperor but now open to the public. Our next stop was the Tomb of Tu Duc alongside a lake with lily pads. Yet, the most impressive site was the Tomb of Khai Dinh, named after its emperor in the 1900s, which had an awesome sculptured stairway and a courtyard full of stone soldiers guarding the tomb.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe afternoon sightseeing ended with lunch at Mandarin Café on Hung Vuong Street, just a few blocks from our hotel and the river. The owner, Mr. Cu, is also an accomplished photographer who sells his postcards to visitors. I couldn’t resist a handful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I walked back to the hotel, I discovered a cultural center, XQ Co Do (established April 1994), where young girls were demonstrating the revitalized art of Vietnamese silk embroidery. I then relaxed at a spa adjacent to the Huong Giang Hotel with an hour’s worth of full leg and foot massage for a mere $8.00.</p>\r\n<p>After Hue, we flew to Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, where the city was celebrating its 1,000-year birthday. The city touts lots of history, from the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum where the body of the former communist leader resides, the nearby Presidential Palace, and Ho Chi Minh Museum, to the 12th century Confucian Temple of Literature, Vietnam’s first university—all surrounded by some of the country’s most stunning French colonial architecture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHanoi has six million people and a swarm of three million motor bikes, which I had to skirt constantly while saying many prayers!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Beauty of Halong Bay</strong></p>\r\n<table width="200" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="left">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="200" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="150" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/350.0.1.0.16777215.0.stories.large.2010.08.26.Boat.JPG" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><em>The wooden junk, Indochina Sails, glides past limestone islands jutting from emerald waters in Halong Bay.</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="200" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="150" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/350.0.1.0.16777215.0.stories.large.2010.08.26.Group.JPG" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><em>DECKSIDE REPOSE: Members of the tour group relax on the ship in Halong Bay.</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The highlight of my journey through the historic cities of Vietnam was the UNESCO Site and natural wonder of Halong Bay in the Gulf of Tonkin. Just a four-hour drive east of the capital city of Hanoi, Halong Bay drew me into a magical setting of 3,000 limestone islands, formed from sea deposits millions of years ago, jutting out of emerald waters. However, legend tells how a dragon’s flailing tail carved out these magnificent islets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur group stayed overnight on a junk, or large wooden boat, which appeared to glide along the bay as we relaxed on board while viewing awesome grottoes and caves. As we toured through one cave, I was amazed by the massive stalactites carved by the water over millions of years and the spaciousness of the tunnels, which made this cave appear more like a fantasy underworld—a la “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater, the group donned bathing suits and joyfully jumped into the cool, clear waters as a relief from the heat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the next morning’s breakfast, I savored the fresh, sweet taste of pineapple and papaya on my palate, which was enough to energize me for the return trip back to Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I gazed out at the diamond-sparkling waters, I realized how grateful I was to be far away from any remembrances of war, the whizzing of motor bikes, and the frenetic city life. All was so peaceful and calm amid Mother Nature’s creative sculptures and landscape.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:26', '2010-12-26 10:23:26'),

In every nook and cranny of the village, the workers are concentrating on different kinds of statues. Each worker has his own task; some saw the timber while others carve the wood and paint the statues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter painstakingly painting a horizontal lacquered board, Nguyen Viet Da, an 85 year-old artisan in the village, tells visitors about his village‘s profession. According to Da, the imitation antique statues are often made from three different types of timber brought in from the central highlands, Hai Phong or even imported from Cambodia. Only jackfruit wood can be used to carve the reproduction antique Buddha statues, as it is soft, durable and easy to carve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the raw timber, the skillful workers easily carve statues of Amitabha (the Buddha of Infinite Light) and the God of Prosperity, or create horizontal lacquered boards with parallel sentences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe workers must go through dozens of steps before finishing a product including selecting the wood, carving it, then painting it. This highly skilled work requires great patience and concentration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“These wooden objects are for worship, therefore the maker must have a good heart and mind,” said Da.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSharing his point of view, Nguyen Viet Loi, another popular artisan in the village said the statutes can only be perfect if the workers put all their concentration into the work. This is why the statues made in Son Dong village are quite easily distinguished from others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSustainably preserving and developing the craft village and tourism is a concern of all the workers in Son Dong workers. To achieve that, the village has made considerable changes. Along with wooden statues, the villagers are now making objects that contain traditional and spiritual elements of the Vietnamese culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe familiar image of the areca nut, betel leaf, calabash and luffa can now be seen in many of the village’s unique products. Moreover, the statues of Buddha and fairies are now being made colourful and small enough to fit in a man’s hand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEntering the shop of Nguyen Chi Thanh, is one of the trailblazers in making new products, and when visitors enter his shop they feel that they are in a mini museum displaying carefully designed wooden statues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh said that these new products have been very popular and preferred by the international markets. Foreign visitors are willing to pay high prices for these products, which helps generate work for most of the villagers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the villagers still want their products to reach domestic customers and for their village to become more popular and attract more domestic tourists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I am considering a price frame for our products so that they will be appropriate for each particular market and also trying to fill a niche in the home market,” said Thanh.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/2201008171104442010081711054820100817110905.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/3201008171104442010081711054820100817110906.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/4201008171104452010081711054820100817110906.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/5201008171104452010081711054920100817110906.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/6201008171104452010081711054920100817110907.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/7201008171104462010081711054920100817110907.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/8201008171104462010081711054920100817110907.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/10201008171104472010081711055020100817110907.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/11201008171104472010081711055020100817110908.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/12201008171104482010081711055020100817110908.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/082010/17/11/13201008171104482010081711055120100817110908.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:28', '2010-12-26 10:23:28'),

We passed many green gardens and rice fields on both sides before entering a rocky area with small springs and waterfalls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We are arriving at Pa Co,” the young local guide said, “Do you want to get off and walk to enjoy the sights and cool air?”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeeing the blazing sun outside, myself and some other Vietnamese girls hesitated but the excitement and cheerful faces of other foreign travelers while exploring the scenery and taking photographs finally urged us to get out of our seats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo our surprise, we seemed to have escaped to some celestial cooler climate in just 45 minutes! The sun was still shining brightly but it could not compete against the fresh and cool wind from the corn fields or the tea and plum gardens surrounding us. We breathed in the fresh air and sighed with relief.</p>\r\n<p>Pa Co is the furthest commune of Mai Chau District in the northwest of Hoa Binh Province, bordering Son La Province’s Moc Chau District. The green, peaceful oasis sits on an area which is nearly 1,000 metres above sea level. This altitude offers Pa Co a really cool climate in the summer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Just two decades ago, this place was famous for its vast poppy fields and drug smugglers,” said the tour guide, adding, “But things have changed dramatically following the Government policies since 1993 which encouraged local people to fell the poppy and grow tea, corn, and plum. The poppy fields have now turned to verdant plum and peach gardens or immense corn and tea fields as you can see”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“And thanks to the transformation, Pa Co is now becoming a beautiful plateau which attracts more and more tourists who wish to discover the culture and lifestyle of the local Mong people,” he added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe then stopped at Tra Day Tea Factory, established by a local man named Pha. After enjoying Shan Tuyet tea (made from old tea plants grown on the high mountains), we were taken by Mr. Pha to visit the tea gardens.</p>\r\n<p>“This tree is more than a hundred years old,” he pointed to a very high tea tree. “All the others in this garden are approximately that age. Our ancestors have grown tea all over the mountains here but many of them were destroyed to grow poppies. Now we have only about 1,000 old trees left.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow tea is becoming one of the specialties that Pa Co has to offer to tourists as well as neighbouring communes. Thanks to this specialty, the life of more than 400 local Mong households is getting better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe met Sung A Lu, a local patriarch in a garden. Lu told us that tea was now their most valuable property. “It is bringing us a healthy and prosperous life,” he said. Lu also added that revenue from tea is making up one third of local people’s total income.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a walk around the beautiful Tra Day Village was really a nice experience. It is a large valley surrounded by mountains and hills where people live very close to one another. We were greeted by friendly smiles along the way and a lot of “hellos” were sent from the small windows and doors. A group of boys playing on the road, a young girl weaving scarves near her door, an old man growing vegetables in his small garden - all of them painted a beautiful and lively picture of the peaceful way of life here. Stopping at a house, we were invited by its owner to have some peaches and boiled corn. Once, I was told, visitors would be invited to try some opium. Things have changed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe local rustic Mong people are still finding tourism a really new concept. There is no house or service designed for tourists. Yet the green peaceful oasis has been discovered by some travel companies as well as backpackers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow you can add Pa Co next to Lac or Pom Coong villages when you come to explore the stunning natural beauty and local ethnic people’s rich culture of Hoa Binh Province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How to get there:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>-By motorbike or car. It takes about 4 hours from Hanoi, following National Road No.6.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Home-stay service has not developed yet, but it is an ideal place for 1-day picnic with lunch on top of the hill.</strong></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:29', '2010-12-26 10:23:29'),

The family and their 3 excited dogs will greet you as you''re offered iced tea and the sweetest jackfruit you’ve ever tasted—straight off the tree hanging above your head.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to Green Vietnam Ecolodge, an agrarian paradise with a purpose. This family owned and operated homestay lodge gives guests the rare opportunity to see life on a real Vietnamese farm, to relish the tranquil charm of the natural surroundings, and to support an important cause all at once.</p>\r\n<p>All proceeds from the lodge feed directly back into the development of the farm’s ecologically conscious agricultural practices and village-wide training efforts, led by the owner, 31-year-old Vuong Ngoc Quang.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuests are offered a comfortable bed in a quiet, rustic, rebuilt Tay stilt house, a short walk up a viney path from the family’s own one-room house. Soon you’re settled in and relaxing on the upper terrace, overlooking lush fruit orchards and the pastoral valley beyond, wondering if its been only minutes since you’ve arrived, or hours or days. City dwellers may have nearly forgotten the feeling of clean air in their lungs before being reminded here.</p>\r\n<p>The lodge can accommodate up to fourteen guests, most of them in a single large room, with two smaller, private rooms available as well. The bath and shower are attached to the side of the building, so you can watch the sun rise over the valley as you brush your teeth in the morning. Despite spotty electricity throughout the province, it stays pleasantly cool throughout the night with the fresh breezes blowing in off the hillside through the open sides of the house.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeals are a truly special affair when you stay at the Ecolodge. Each dish is made from local, fresh ingredients, many of them from the family’s own organic vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and pig farm.</p>\r\n<p>There’s grilled pork similar to bun cha, fried nem with meat and home-made mien noodles, and all-natural tofu produced locally using traditional methods, with no additives or fillers. You can really taste the difference; not only is Huyen’s cooking a step above, but the ingredients themselves are bursting with flavor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s not only the food that makes this a treat; meals are eaten family-style, sitting in a circle on bamboo floor mats. Their two children chatter with each other and with any cousins, aunts or uncles who have gathered for the meal. Everyone is clearly comfortable with the presence of visitors in their home. It’s the perfect opportunity to practice your conversational Vietnamese, but don’t worry; even if you speak very little, Quang and Huyen’s English is excellent.</p>\r\n<p>After supper, you may be offered a glass or two of the farm’s own premium-quality rice wine, available in snake, gecko, or seahorse varieties, or with tamer infusions like blackberry, honeycomb, and lychee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuang is brimming with stories, information, and guidance. He can show you around the farm and the surrounding village or point you in the right direction for hiking, swimming, and exploring caves or waterfalls.</p>\r\n<p>Or, you can simply take a spectacular ride through the province, where you can take in more of the luscious farmland, the clusters of Tay and Hoa stilt houses, and the iconic scenes of women bent over in the rice fields and buffalo cooling themselves in pools along the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, the country life is a lot more than postcard pictures and smiling faces; it’s hard work, and many of the farmers in this region struggle to get by on their crops of cassava, rice, and corn, especially with increasing drought. This is where Quang’s eco-farm comes in; he’s working to train farmers in the region to adopt practices that aim not only to improve the environment, but also to alleviate poverty.</p>\r\n<p>At the core of his mission is the replacement of cassava and corn with fruit trees and indigenous hardwoods, which yield significantly higher profits and effectively conserve water and the soil’s nutrients.</p>\r\n<p>A new bio-gas system has also been installed, which will process pig manure into methane gas to fuel generators that will power irrigation pumps and, with time, Quang hopes, the entire farm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lodge opened in September 2009; since that time they’ve already attracted 140 guests, the highest number of any spot in the province.</p>\r\n<p>Quang has partnered with the owner of La Vie Vu Linh, another eco-lodge located nearby in neighboring Yen Bai Province. He explains that many tourists hop from one place to the other, given their proximity and similar missions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a few short days at the Green Vietnam Ecolodge, you’ll probably find yourself feeling healthier and calmer. Suddenly the noise and traffic of Hanoi and the frenetic tourist sites seem a million miles away and you may just decide you like it that way.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, you can’t stay forever, but when you have to leave, you''ll do so feeling you’ve experienced something extraordinary and contributed to a material cause for the future of sustainable agriculture in Vietnam.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/anhpt/082010/13/09/eco_2.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The lodge is a relocated, renovated Tay stilt house.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/anhpt/082010/13/09/eco_3.jpg" /><br />\r\n</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A delicious dinner with extended family.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/anhpt/082010/13/09/eco_4.jpg" /><br />\r\n</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Vuong Ngoc Quang, owner and manager of the eco-farm and lodge, shows off one of his pomelo orchards.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img width="500" height="375" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/anhpt/082010/13/09/eco_5.jpg" /><br />\r\n</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A sizeable lake near the farm, which can be used for boating and swimming.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Brochures for Green Vietnam Ecolodge can be found at their partner  office in Hanoi: Free Wheelin’ Tours (28 Dao Duy Tu).

They choose a place where  many people will pass and gradually, these exchange places become bigger  and bigger to make a real market.</p>\n<p>Markets often gather 3-5 times a week and are divided into main and  sub-gatherings. For the main gatherings, the atmosphere is always more  exciting and the market lasts longer. Each village will sell one kind of  special good such as bamboo baskets, iron hoes, knives, etc. By looking  at what’s on sale at a village’s market, we can easily guess the local  trade. If we see a lot of conical hats on sale, then those living in the  area are likely hat makers. The sub-gatherings are less crowded and  tend to sell only essential foods.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.dtinews.vn/news/beautiful-vietnam/hanoi/top-hats_2512.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Chuong Market</span></a> in Thanh Oai District, Hanoi is a typical village  market. Villagers here gather 6 times a month, on the 4th, 10th, 14th,  20th, 24th and 30th, and sell only one product: conical hats and the  materials to make them.</p>\n<p>Like Chuong Hat Village in Hanoi, Dong Bang Mat Market in Thai Binh Province, Ba Ren Pig market in the central Quang Nam or Cai Rang Floating Market in the southern Can Tho Province, are also some famous ones among thousands of village markets in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Village markets in Vietnam, which are said to have existed for thousands of years, are not only a mere goods-exchanging place but also a special cultural feature that highlights the traits and lifestyle of people living in the countryside. They are farmers and artisans who usually have to struggle to make ends meet. However, unlike the situation at markets in the big city, there is little need to bargain for the products sold because at the village markets, buyers and sellers are all relatives, neighbors or know one another very well.</p>\n<p>“We all know one another very well here in our village’s market,” said my friend who is living in Voc Village in northern Nam Dinh Province, “Things are sold and purchased very quickly so we can come home early to get to the rice fields.”</p>\n<p>The foods being sold at village markets are fresh but not carefully chosen or beautifully arranged like those in the city markets. A basket of crab or shellfish would have been caught during the previous night or the day before. Vegetables are also very fresh. These products are all collected from the sellers’ crop after putting aside enough for their family’s needs.</p>\n<p>As most Vietnamese people have grown up in a village, village markets have become a comforting picture of home. Many people have left their quiet villages for the exciting cities, but the memories of the old days remain forever. As in the case of Truong Ngoc Binh, who is now living and working in San Jose, America. Binh was born and grew up in Bac Ninh, a northern province with a long and rich culture.</p>\n<p>“In my memory, our village’s Buu Market represents the most carefree and peaceful time in life,” Binh revealed. “I remember getting up early and going with my younger sister and brother to a small bridge to wait for my mother’s return from the market. We would sit there, trying to guess if my mother was in the group of women approaching us. When the familiar figure of mother appeared from far away, we all rushed out to greet her and help her carry something if we could.”</p>\n<p>When Tet holiday nears, village markets suddenly become much busier. After a year working hard, it’s time for people to relax, and Vietnamese people find the market a good place to gather and meet one another. The markets are bigger than normal and besides a bigger range of foods being offered for sale, people often hold a small fair featuring traditional games such as ferris wheels, lottery, dragon dancing, etc. These markets usually last from December 29 to January 3rd of the lunar year.</p>\n<p>Village’s markets have played the role of a cultural and entertainment centre for the farmers and are a vital part of every village.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:31', '2010-12-26 10:23:31'),

The street has the same  glittering colour and is always bustling like any other street in the  old quarter. Fortunately, there are still two addresses where visitors  can learn about the place’s erstwhile trade.</p>\r\n<p>At the place of old craftsmen, at Number 30, you can still see a small furnace. Being the fourth and last generation in his family to follow the trade, Nguyen Huu Lai, 65, seems rather proud to recall his family’s long tradition in the trade.</p>\r\n<p>“In the past, Lo Ren Street was a familiar address for almost every farmer and construction contractor in Hanoi and its neighbouring areas,” he proudly shared, “To meet the demand of customers, my family’s furnace used to work every day from early morning until late at night.”</p>\r\n<p>Not everyone can watch the old blacksmith at work. Lai directs visitors, who do not arrive on the right day, to No. 26.</p>\r\n<p>“I do not forge very often now. Once in a while, I make some small tools, mainly for fun.

He was a skilled blacksmith who made the first weaving machine for Van Phuc Silk village based on a French version. My father mainly forged theatre instruments like swords, knives, etc.”</p>\r\n<p>During his own early years in the family job, Hung forged agricultural tools like sickles, hoes, and ploughshares. “Now, machines are replacing them all. Also, our handmade knives, scissors … can’t compete with the cheap Chinese products on the market.”</p>\r\n<p>Hung remembers that just a decade ago there were a few other families doing the work but now he is the only blacksmith on Lo Ren Street.</p>\r\n<table width="200" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="right">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="300" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="225" border="0" align="right" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/lanhieu/082010/04/21/DSC04952.jpg" alt="" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td style="text-align: right;"><em>Hung is the last blacksmith in the capital now</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>“Like many other streets in the old quarter, services are booming  here.

I am proud I can make more  sophisticated products than many modern machines.

However, since he is the only blacksmith here, he has many orders to keep him busy and earn enough to enjoy a comfortable life.</p>\r\n<p>The compensation is small compared to the amount of work required.</p>\r\n<p>Sitting beside his 200-year-old furnace, wearing a torn shirt, dampened with sweat and smeared with soot, the blacksmith talks in a loud voice and tells his visitors to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>“Anyone who has done this work will have problems with their ears. We have to live with the deafening noise every day,” he explained.</p>\r\n<p>He also shows us many scars on his arms and hands.</p>\r\n<p>On a hot summer day, the middle-aged blacksmith still seems very relaxed.

The restaurant is also riding on a growing trend of vegetarianism, increasingly popular in Vietnam, especially in the two big cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh.</p>\r\n<p>Hoang Mai, a 25 year-old receptionist at VinCom City Towers, was enjoying rice with fried fish and crab soup while her two friends were having fried chicken and beef noodle; minus the fish, crab, chicken and beef. “It tastes great,” Mai smiled. “The interesting thing is that I can eat as much chicken as I want without worrying about putting on weight,” Mai’s friend Minh Thu laughed. “It’s made of bean.”</p>\r\n<p>Mai said that it was the third time they came here and they loved the food. “We are not Buddhists but we think that eating vegetarian food is good for our health,” she said. More than that, Minh Thu hopes to loose weight this way. “I am following a strict diet to loose weight,” she said. “Coming here I have many choices.”</p>\r\n<p>Many local people, especially the younger generation, are turning vegetarian for a variety of reasons. “At first, I started going to a vegetarian restaraunt when I grew sick of meat, and gradually I started really enjoying vegetarian meals,” Phan Linh remembered. “Fortunately, a manager at the restaurant has suggested a suitable diet to treat my stomachache. Now I eat vegetarian food two times a week.”</p>\r\n<p>Nguyen Tien Minh, manager of a fashion shop on Chua Boc Street said he likes eating vegetarian foods because it gives him “peace in mind”.</p>\r\n<p>“I am a Buddhist and besides, the 1st and 15th day of every lunar month, I eat vegetarian food whenever I am under stress or pressure. At home I also often cook vegetarian food for the whole family.</p>\r\n<p>According to Trinh Huong Thuy, manager of Huong Thuy Vegetarian Restaurant on Truong Đinh Street, more and more people are turning to vegetarian food. Her restaurant is often overcrowded, especially on the 1st or 15th day of the lunar month. “Many people have to order our delivery service,” she said.</p>\r\n<p>To meet customer demands, other than normal dishes like rice served with tofu, vegetables, noodle with mushroom, and so on, restaurants are now making many special dishes that look like normal foods such as fried chicken, stewed steak, and noodle with beef and chicken, with some tricky meat substitutes.</p>\r\n<p>Vegetarian food is also attracting people at the market and supermarket. Other than fresh foods, Vietnamese vegetarians now have an array of tinned, frozen or dried products to choose from.</p>\r\n<p>Buddhist philosophy says that eating vegetarian food has many advantages such as long life, less disease, less hostility and heaven after death. But as vegetarian food gets a better rap and better taste, non-Buddhists are beginning to realize the health benefits of dropping the meat.</p>\r\n<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" align="center" style="width: 602px; height: 24px;">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor="#999999">\r\n            <p><strong>Vegetarian restaurants:</strong></p>\r\n            <p>-Hanoi:</p>\r\n            <p>* Nang Tam, 79 Tran Hung Dao Street, tel: 04.39424140; have some 70  different vegetarian dishes, opening for lunch and dinner.</p>\r\n            <p>* Quan Ngoai O, 32 Ba Trieu Street, tel: 04.62784406, serve Vietnamese  vegetarian buffet featuring 35 dishes.

Since ancient times, it has been a traditional practice for Bahnar people to build a shelter for the grave and prepare for the deceased a life that resembles one of the living, from Rong houses (communal houses), plants, cross-bows, looms, to bowls and plates. B’Yang Village has even set aside an area of 4 hectares with the belief that the dead also need land where they can build their homes and till the fields.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike Kinh people (the majority of the Vietnamese population), a few times a year, Bahnar people pay respects and burn incense for loved ones who have passed away. The final resting place (often a wooden house) is only built, in place of the grave’s shelter, after the “Leaving-the-grave” (Le Bo Ma) ceremony, the last festivity to see off the deceased to another world. People with less money have to build a smaller shelter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Le Bo Ma, villagers often gather at the cemetery ground to sing, dance, have a feast and sleep at the place overnight on the first day. On the second day, they would sleep at the village’s Rong house, and on the third day, close relatives are to sleep at the deceased ones family’s home. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, to mourn for the dead, many of the villagers would hit their head repetitively on a column or wooden wall, and not stop until they bleed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Bahnar people''s burial place</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGlancing over the Bahnar people’s cemetery grounds, one could easily mistaken it for a small village situated next to the Ba River. The grave houses here are all meticulously decorated and it is easy to tell from each of these grave houses it whether its owner had been rich or poor. Some had their roof made out of steel panels as a result of urbanisation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurrounding these tombs are plants grown by the people of the village such as bananas and sugarcane. In the front yard, there would be a jar and water as well as a water dipper. Before the house is an unfinished burning wood stove. Inside the house has all the items necessary for everyday life such as bowls, baskets, and dried wood logs. A woman’s house would have a loom, while that of a man would have a cross-bow and arrows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order for the deceased to have a rich and comfortable life, the Bahnar people often carve wooden statues resembling human beings, birds, or animals to accompany them. These statues are also often carved according to the deceased ones liking and occupation when they were alive, and everything must go in pairs following the concept of yin and yang, even statues of the animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmid dozens of tombs in this cemetery ground, the 20 square-metre grave house of Dinh Gliu, former head of Kong Chro Town’s Culture Board, stands out as the highest and most elaborate structure. Four main pillars are decorated with 4 symbolic pairs of tusks, along with the two highest decorated poles in the cemetery. At the front and back of the house are 2 pairs of couples, one in soldier’s uniform and one in modern clothing. A cross-bow used for hunting is also placed inside the house.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChrum added, “All the things that the deceased used in life will be brought to their final resting place. The living are responsible for providing a prosperous life for the dead.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/082010/03/11/nha-mo-220100803110630.jpg" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecorated poles are thought to help the spirits to go to heaven.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/082010/03/11/nha-mo20100803110630.jpg" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe family who built this “house” couldn’t afford an elaborate structure.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/082010/03/11/nha-mo-320100803110630.jpg" /><br />\r\n</em><em><br />\r\nThe cemetery village has been urbanised.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/082010/03/11/nha-mo-120100803110630.jpg" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThings that the deceased used in their life are brought to the the tomb.<br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:37', '2010-12-26 10:23:37'),

Optional condiments include chili sauce, Maggi (a bottled sauce of Swiss origin) and soy sauce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrdered to go, banh mi comes wrapped in scrap paper secured with a rubber band, a portable meal epitomizing Saigon''s "insatiable appetite and deep desires, for better or worse, to keep moving," says Ms. Truong, who was born in Saigon, now officially called Ho Chi Minh City.<br />\r\nThe History<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe French introduced baguettes to Vietnam, where the locals called the narrow loaves banh tay (literally, "foreign cake").<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"Banh tay were for rich Vietnamese. They dipped them in sweetened condensed milk," recalls 83-year-old Thinh Thi Nguyen, who was born in a village near Hanoi. She didn''t eat her first baguette sandwich until she was 20; by then Vietnamese called them banh mi ("mi" means "wheat").<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1954 French rule ended, Vietnam was split in two, and many of the north''s shopkeepers moved to noncommunist South Vietnam. Former northerners like 78-year-old Ding Chieu Nguyen, whose family had owned a banh mi shop in Hanoi, made Saigon the new sandwich capital. Her Saigon banh mi shop, Hoa Ma Quan, remains one of the city''s most popular after 50 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFood shortages followed the end of the war and reunification of the country in 1975, and banh mi was once again an extravagance. But free-market reforms in the late ''80s unleashed Vietnam''s entrepreneurial spirit and banh mi resurfaced, mostly as street food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese days vendors stuff baguettes with cheese, tinned sardines in tomato sauce, shredded chicken, grilled pork patties, meatballs in sweet barbecue sauce, fried eggs cooked to order and, especially on the first and 15th of the lunar month (when many Buddhists eschew meat), gluten and bean curd.<br />\r\nThe Setting<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaguette sandwiches are sold from shop fronts, push carts, motorbikes and shoulder poles. "Why buy all the pieces and put them together when it''s so easy" to hit the streets? asks Saigon native Van Luk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on the time of day and the size of its baguette, banh mi can be a snack or a meal. "I like it best in the morning and in the evening," says Ms. Luk. "It''s too heavy for lunch, when we prefer rice or soup."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Truong, however, reckons that "every hour is banh mi hour," as long as the sandwich is eaten "within five minutes of it being made. There is something close to alchemy," she says, "when the baguette is still hot and has lent its warmth to the pâté and the [sausage], while not wilting the cilantro or cucumber spears."<br />\r\nThe Judgment<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese days most baguettes are made with a combination of wheat and rice flours, resulting in a fluffy crumb and exceptionally crackly crust. Some consumers feel this adds a welcome textural dimension to the banh mi, but Vietnamese old enough to remember traditional French-style baguettes don''t always agree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Ms. Luk, the filling is the key: "The pâté shouldn''t smell too strong, the ham and pork should be excellent quality." And the mayonnaise, she adds, should be made in-house, with fresh eggs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike the city that calls the sandwich its own, banh mi continues to evolve. Several shops in Saigon have recently introduced baguettes stuffed with pork roasted on a spit. But die-hard fans have their limits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"I don''t want to hear about the shiitake- or portobello-mushroom banh mi," says Ms. Truong. "I''m sure there are lovely mushroom sandwiches, but let''s not kid ourselves."<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" align="center" style="width: 427px; height: 24px;">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor="#999999"><strong>The Sources</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Hoa Ma Quan sets Saigon''s banh mi thit pace with big, warm, crusty  baguettes, homemade mayonnaise and heavenly pâté.

It shares a border with China and is home to the country’s northernmost point. It has previously enticed only the intrepid traveller though in recent years improved road access has made it easier than ever before to explore this extraordinary mountainous realm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRoads may be smooth, but it is still a hard slog from Hanoi. Ha Giang town is located in a beautiful valley urrounded by thick forest and grey, rocky mountains – seven hours by car or bus from the capital city. As soon as I arrive the long day of travel catches up with me. I find a guest house for the night and get a good night’s rest after a simple but delicious meal of cabbage, chicken and rice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the morning I rise at 6am, ready to head to Dong Van (Heaven’s Gate) in the highlands, 150km from Ha Giang. The town is still thick with mist as the sun starts to rise. I drive up through the clouds on the all-new road. It is a far cry from what was here before. It took eight years to open this stretch of road from Ha Giang town to Dong Van. Thousands of labourers broke the rock bit by bit and inched their way up into the highlands. When I stop for a rest I stand alone. I am surrounded by imposing mountains and thick clouds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of this area is too mountainous for agriculture. Much of the land is covered by forest. Along the road I spot plum, peach and persimmon trees. Here and there I pass a thatched house lying silently in a valley down below the mountain pass. I stop and take in the view and breathe in the mystical air. On the road local kids carry piles of wood or baskets of vegetables. They walk slowly and quietly as if afraid to disturb the silence that is all around them. At times when you come around a sharp bend, the sudden magnificence of the views will take your breath away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless hills roll towards the horizon under the autumn sun. It is easy to admire the panorama as I occasionally stop while driving around on a motorcycle, but I also can’t help thinking about how hard life must be for the locals, who must negotiate these mountains and precipitous slopes on a daily basis. I can see light yellow soil amongst the rugged rocks. In these tiny fields, Mong farmers walk behind buffalo-pulled ploughs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe women walk behind spreading fertiliser or sowing the maize seeds. There is probably nowhere else in the country, where you can find such tiny corn fields in such extreme conditions. The food source is vital for the local families and ensuring that the crop has a chance to grow is hard work. “We have to gather good soil from all around and then we transport it in bamboo baskets on our backs to a field amongst the rocks,” says 28-year old Thao Thi Ngai. “Then after sowing seeds, we have to carry water on our backs to water the plants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We grow corn, raise chicken and pigs but we rarely eat pork or chicken. Mostly we just eat corn or cabbage. We use corn to brew alcohol for sale or for our husbands!” It is hard to describe the feeling you have when you are so far from what you know. Standing here with Ngai in the far northeast of Vietnam while listening to how hard her life is I can’t even picture the city anymore. Visions of my office and my desk seem out of reach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am left in awe at the spectacular mountains and left humbled by the simple lives and patience of the local people. They have somehow eked out a living in the most extreme conditions. Here amongst the rocky highlands, somehow, crops grow and flowers bloom.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:41', '2010-12-26 10:23:41'),

High in iron, it is also rich in vitamin B-complex and vitamin C, minerals, potassium and essential amino acids. Amazingly your energy level stays at a nice constant rate with its great composition of fructose, sucrose and some cholesterol free fats. My friend swore by its nutritional benefits and ate it throughout her pregnancy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why is this incredible fruit banned in certain establishments in Asian countries? Apparently for its infectious smell which I did not understand until I had my first personal whiff. Amazingly, I found this aroma to be neither foul nor disgusting as most would expect. At first I thought I had left a great piece of cheese in the fridge, since I live in France, it happens often enough. For the next few days, this odor invaded my space, lingering long enough for me to judge for myself. The smell has an unusual mixture of fresh vomit mixed with a lush creaminess. A perfect melange of love or hate. For me, it was love at first smell. I just could not wait to taste it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally the day came where I was told the fruit was ready to be opened and eaten. At last I was going to see and taste this intoxicating fruit. When I saw my friend arrive with a large butcher cleaver, I stepped back out of the way just to be safe from her wild swings. I couldn''t believe the physical effort it took to open the armor-like shell but when it was done, all I could see were 4 to 6 buttery looking bulges cocooned in their snug shell. Without even realizing it, I scooped one of the fruit with my fingers and ate it. It was like nothing I have ever eaten before: creamy, thick, slightly stringy like a mango, smooth, sweet and addictive. I had officially joined the rest of the Durian lovers of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had recently gone to the Asian supermarket in Paris to acquire another one of these delicious fruits and much to my delight, they had just received a delivery. However, it was not as easy of a task as I had assumed it would be to pick tasty one. It is too painful and heavy to lift and squeeze with bare hands to test for its ripeness and I have no idea how to choose one by its aroma. Then this kind man wearing thick leather garden gloves came to my rescue and explained to me the basics. The armor shell should be flexible when squeezed, it should make some noise when shaken and I was told to see if there were visible lines on the outer shell then its a winner! That day I had chosen two, one to eat immediately and one to be eaten at a later date. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is still a mystery as to why I am haunted by the Durian, maybe for its aphrodisiac claim or just simply for its compelling taste. Who knows and honestly, who cares. I just want to eat it.</p>\r\n<table width="544" height="122" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" align="center" style="">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor="#999999">Nathalie Girod was raised in a culinary environment with her  international family.

It’s an extremely popular meal that’s often overlooked by guidebooks and seldom-tried by tourists or even long term residents of Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA number of street side restaurants down Phat Loc alley in the Old Quarter serve up extremely tasty renditions of this dish, which seems simple, nourishing and healthy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy friends and I like to argue over which vendor’s broth is the best, but first-time culinary adventurers shouldn’t worry so much. Each stall is consistent and of a high standard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seating is rudimentary – small plastic stools and chairs. But you don’t come here to enjoy plush surroundings! As soon as you sit down one of the cooks starts to fry up some tofu while cutting the long rice noodle strings up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tofu is added before the broth is poured into the bowl. The ‘mam tom’ – not everyone’s cup of tea! – is tweaked with some lime juice and pepper. A few chunks of cha com (grilled chopped meat mashed up with green rice flakes) are also added. Lastly, you get served a plate of assorted greens to add to the mix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt seems easy to make, but inevitably homemade attempts never satisfy the craving like the restaurants along Phat Loc do. All the restaurant owners claim the secret is carefully selected materials rather than age-old techniques. According to Tran Thi Huong, the owner of the arguably the most famous restaurant at 49 Phat Loc, no one ingredient is more important than another. The end product is the perfect symphony of deliciousness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst of all, the rice noodles must come from Phu Do in Hanoi’s Tu Liem district, where rice noodle production is the village’s traditional trade. These rice noodles are much thinner than normal strands of bun you might sample around town. The cha com is made with green rice flakes (com) from Vong village and the mam tom comes from Thanh Hoa province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople often just eat bun dau for lunch, so the restaurants are only open from 11am till 2pm. A bowl normally costs VND10,000 to VND15,000 so bun dau is universally adored. You can see well-heeled young professional women side by side with vendors in conical hats. You can find bun dau sold on the road side of a number of streets around Hanoi, but ask anyone and they’ll surely agree, bun dau mam tom on Phat Loc alley is the bees-knees.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:44', '2010-12-26 10:23:44'),

Da Nang is one of the few places that could offer such a diverse variety of activities for tourists, whether they want to go hiking up a mountain or go sunbathing at the beach, and there are many options for hotels as well as restaurants in the area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The domestic tourism market in general is seeing a strong rise, as travelling has been made more affordable for Vietnamese tourists in recent years. Now, during school holidays, many families take the opportunity to have a family getaway,” Dung said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLoc also pointed out that because this year’s summer has been hotter than other years, the idea of dipping oneself in the cool sea is extremely appealing, therefore, many have come to the central coast to spend their holidays.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel companies have said that an increase in flights, accomodation, coaches, tour guides and professionalism in these services would help tourism to flourish even further in central Vietnam.<br />\r\n</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:44', '2010-12-26 10:23:44'),

But nowadays, it’s easy to get to Tham Nam. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCivilians said that they have found many ancient artifacts there such as daggers and statues of female dancers. There are places inside the caves which have enough space for hundreds of people to relax and enjoy fascinating cave formations developed over thousands of years and sparkling quartz scattered all over the caves roof. There is also a stream running through the cave with cool, clean water that has an abundance of shrimp and fish. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, several cultural activities were often held in Tham Nam and other neighbouring caves. However, these activities are no longer organised and the caves remain rarely visited. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVi Tan Hoi, Vice Chairman of the People’s Committee of Tuong Duong District shared, “In the near future, Tham Nam will be an attractive and enchanting destination for tourists.

When I first broached the subject – a tour of bakeries in Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon as it''s still commonly known – Thanh stared at me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had hired Thanh as a translator. With him came the driver, a stoic man I knew only as Mr. Tan. We were exploring the city''s temples and museums. Soon we would approach the Reunification Palace, whose gates were breached by North Vietnamese tanks 35 years ago. French bread didn''t fit the day''s equation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, I insisted on my quest, revealing that I was a journalist interested in Vietnamese culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"Why don''t you write about rice?" Thanh asked. "Here, rice is more common than bread."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI did my best to channel Anthony Bourdain, conjuring phrases like "the sociopolitical ramifications of baked goods." France had subjugated Vietnam in colonial rule for nearly 80 years, and I wanted to examine some of the residue. As Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote: "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh turned to Mr. Tan, who was navigating his black Toyota through the traffic. Thanh said something in Vietnamese, and they both chuckled. I imagined the following exchange.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh: "He flies 9,000 miles to Saigon, and all he wants is bread."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Tan: "Yeah, what''s next – barbecue?" <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe American-born son of Chinese immigrants, I had grown up eating rice with all of my meals. When I was young, my family lived in Europe for two years. It was then that I developed an affinity for baguettes and croissants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA central question intrigued me: Could an Asian culture really make good éclairs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur first stop was Binh Tay Market in Cholon, the Chinese district. Vendors sold everything from dragon fruit and dried mushrooms to astrology books and surgical masks with "Hello Kitty" designs. (Motorcyclists wear these masks to fend off the dust and pollution.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh bought a small loaf of bread from a woman who jabbered on, ordering around her employees. Her small stand was an odd oasis amid the piles of sneakers and knock-off designer purses at neighboring stands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh grew up in a town outside of Hanoi. His parents grew rice and sweet potatoes. He was one of only three people from his town to attend college. He was in his 20s before he ever tasted bread, which wasn''t common in the countryside. "I had never seen wheat before," he said. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Thanh, bread was special. People occasionally ate bread for breakfast, he said, but most families he knew reserved it for celebrations. Which seemed at odds with the number of bakeries I saw across Saigon. Clearly, enough people were buying bread every day to support these businesses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI began to theorize that a Vietnamese person''s point of view on bread depended on his or her socio-economic status. Thanh and his wife, a travel agent, were climbing from their modest origins into the middle class. But there was a wide gap between families such as Thanh''s and a small segment of Vietnamese who have become fabulously wealthy as the economy has grown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerhaps it is this affluent group that is propelling the bakeries to great success, embracing the vestiges of French colonialism. If the economic gap continues to widen, and one day the poor people rise up, I can imagine the elites saying, "Let them eat cake."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater that day, as we entered the ABC Bakery, Thanh told me a story. The owner of the ABC Bakery chain had divorced his wife after some libidinal transgression, and she was now a competitor, running another bakery across town. There''s nothing quite like sexual intrigue to spur the production of sinful desserts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had in my mind that the bakery would be cramped; aromatic of bread, sweat and tears; tucked away in some alley. Instead, the ABC Bakery was clean and well-lighted, resembling a Dunkin'' Donuts shop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGlass-enclosed shelves displayed every sort of bun, cookie, cruller, torte, tart, jellyroll, mille-feuille, strudel and something akin to a Hot Pocket. Along the far wall, in a refrigerated case, were dozens of cakes, some topped with plastic animals from the Chinese Zodiac. (Happy birthday, sweetheart, here''s a cobra on your cake.) <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the fumbling-with-the-tongs incident, I brought the baguette back to the car. As Mr. Tan gunned the engine, Thanh and I compared notes. The Binh Tay Market loaf was chewy and stale. But the ABC Bakery baguette was hot and fresh – and sprinkled with sesame seeds. (I can hear the traditionalists mutter, "Sacre bleu.")<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Worth hunting for</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI finally did find that chocolate éclair.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter lunch, Thanh took me to Brodard Bakery off Dong Khoi, formerly Rue Catinat, the city''s main shopping street. The bakery, a tiny shop with a security guard and a window displaying two-tiered wedding cakes, was established in the late 1940s. On the Web, some of the Vietnamese diaspora reminisce about Brodard''s pastries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanh and I split the éclair. It may have been the bakery''s ambience (or "ambivalence," as one review translated from Vietnamese to English put it), but I thought the éclair was one of the best I''ve ever had.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater, I learned that the bakery had been bought by a large corporation that owned several hotels and restaurants. So, strangely enough, that éclair not only represented the residue of French colonialism – it represented the Vietnamese people''s embrace of capitalism, or at least their version of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI doubt any of this crossed Thanh''s mind. He was born in 1978, three years after the fall of Saigon. While he was frank about the effects of the French and American wars on his country, he didn''t exhibit any resentment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor him, the éclair was just an éclair; the baguette was just a baguette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhatever their origins were, they were now part of life here. And Thanh and the other young Vietnamese had made all of what they inherited their own.</p>\r\n<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="center" style="width: 706px; height: 1088px;">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor="#cccccc"><strong>Getting there</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Major U.S. and Asian airlines link Dallas-Fort Worth to Saigon, but you''ll have to make one or two stops, usually in Los Angeles , San Francisco or Chicago, and then in Seoul, Tokyo or Hong Kong.

It''s good for the business traveler, with a business center, health club, room service and tour desk.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <strong>Where to eat</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •For Saigon''s baguettes, croissants and pastries, visit the ABC Bakery (91-91B Cach Mang Thang Tam and several other locations) and Brodard Bakery (11 Nguyen Thiep St.).<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •For pho, the Vietnamese noodle soup, try Pho 2000 (1-3D Phan Chu Trinh) and Pho 24 (5 Nguyen Thiep St. and several other locations, www.pho24.com.vn).<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Most guidebooks and fellow travelers say the best Vietnamese food is served in the street stalls. I have friends who eat street food without getting sick; I''m not as adventurous. Visit the stalls near Ben Thanh Market and Binh Tay Market and look for those that are most crowded. Also, water is not potable in Vietnam. If you eat fresh fruits and vegetables, stick to those that you have to peel to eat.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •To prepare for your trip, try Vietnamese food closer to home. I like Pho Pasteur (100 W. Pioneer Parkway #158, Arlington) and the banh mi sandwiches at La Me (9870 Walnut St., Dallas).<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <strong>Other tips</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Take advantage of Saigon''s proximity to the Mekong Delta to the south and the Cu Chi Tunnels and Cao Dai Holy See Temple to the north. Each region is well worth a day trip.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Pack lots of cotton T-shirts. Vietnam is a hot and humid, and you''ll soak through one or two shirts a day. Also take sunscreen and sun hat.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •There''s nothing like crossing the street in Saigon, with its constant traffic, to build your self-confidence. Do it with a local first, then on your own: Walk at a slow and steady pace, and the traffic will flow around you.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Read Graham Greene''s The Quiet American before heading overseas. It''s a beautifully written novel set in Saigon in the early 1950s, at the end of the war with France, with hints of the coming war with the U.S.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <strong>Resources</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Tourist Information Center (4G-4H Le Loi St.) has maps and information about hotels and restaurants, plus a currency exchange center.<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            •Saigontourist (49 Le Thanh Ton St., www.saigontourist.net) is a large government-run group that operates tours and has a lot of information about Vietnam travel.</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:48', '2010-12-26 10:23:48'),

The statue was of a Chinese general known as La Vong, sitting with a fishing rod.<br />\n<br />\nInside the house 100 years ago, the great-grandfather of the current restaurant owners dreamed up a new way to serve fish, with turmeric, green onion and dill.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2003, the restaurant was included in “1,000 Places To See Before You Die” by American travel writer Patricia Schultz. The MSNBC website later narrowed the book’s list down to the world’s 10 “must see” places, putting Cha Ca La Vong at number five.<br />\n<br />\nThe history of the Doan family is as colorful as the dish it’s famous for.<br />\n<br />\nIn the mid-1800s, the family began allowing Vietnamese soldiers, who were trying to oust the ruling French, to hide in their house. They served their guests their special fish dish, cha ca La Vong.<br />\n<br />\nTo raise extra money to fund their rebel-hiding activities – and provide a cover for the house’s mysterious comings and goings - the family opened a restaurant serving only cha ca La Vong.<br />\n<br />\nThe original recipe remains a Doan family secret but Le Thi Bich Loc, one of the current Doan family restaurateurs, told Vietnam News Agency the secret to cha ca La Vong was making it with quality ingredients.<br />\n<br />\nTo make the dish, Loc said fillets of catfish or snakehead fish are filleted and marinated for at least two hours with galangal, pepper, fish sauce and turmeric. The fillets are then grilled on a coal stove, turned frequently until each piece is a deep golden color.<br />\n<br />\nThe next stage of the cooking is done at the table, on a small pottery burner. The grilled fish is fried with dill, green onions and peanuts, a step that is believed to bring out more flavor.<br />\n<br />\nThe sizzling hot fish fillet mixture is then placed into a bowl with Vietnamese vermicelli, pickled spring onion bulbs and aromatic herbs. The finishing touch is a few drops of fermented shrimp paste.<br />\n<br />\nThe restaurant only buys shrimp paste from northern Thanh Hoa Province. This regional specialty has a light flavor and turns white when mixed with lemon juice.<br />\n<br />\nVietnamese wine is said to further compliment the taste of cha ca La Vong.<br />\n<br />\nThe dish became so famous that Hanoi authorities renamed the entire street Cha Ca Street (Fried Minced Fish Street). The restaurant remains in its original location, at 14 Cha Ca Street in Hanoi, and Cha Ca La Vong was registered as a trademark in 1989.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:49', '2010-12-26 10:23:49');

Besides a daily running routine, he cycled home once a month - a distance of 60 kilometres to Hai Duong.<br />\n<br />\nFor this trip, Hien starts his day at 4.30 am doing volunteer work then begins cycling at 7 am, setting a destination goal that he tells himself to achieve before the end of each day, no matter what obstacles, including heat or rain.

However, the establishment’s problems with supplying power and inability to respond adequately to the needs of guests indicate that it’s got a ways to go before becoming the truly spectacular oasis it has the potential to be.</p>\r\n<p>Guests were given a range of choices in rooms; some went for the cheaper beds in rooms with only fans; others chose to pay a premium for the promise of a cool night’s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Our arrival and welcome from the staff was pleasant, if oddly complicated by a two-step queuing and check-in procedure. Everybody was shown to their rooms, oohing and aahing over the rustic charm of the grounds and the abundant vegetation (think jack-fruits the size of small poodles growing overhead).</p>\r\n<p>The décor is a quirky blend of traditional Vietnamese textiles combined with carved wooden signs and nautical trinkets like wooden ducks and large-scale model ships. The rooms themselves range from basic (and a bit dingy) to grand, complete with old-fashioned carved wooden beds.</p>\r\n<p>After check-in most guests reconvened around the pool, beneath overhanging branches of bamboo and palm. Beer was discovered, and serious relaxation began.</p>\r\n<p>After a couple of hours splashing about or relaxing in thatched huts scattered around the lush grounds, we all migrated to the open courtyard for dinner: a parade of courses from pork skewers and squid salad to roast chicken and fried fish, and lots in between. You could tell from the hush that the delicious food was well appreciated—that is, until dusk fell and the lights cut out. The staff apologized, and after a few moments the lights were back up so we thought little of it.</p>\r\n<p>With dinner over, special guest DJs Polo, Kulture, and Cybersnack set up their equipment. Throughout the following hours, as the three DJ wizards spun their musical magic, more failures and surges in power broke the flow of the beats several times, bringing dancers to a halt and worse, threatening to damage the pricey sound equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Soon word traveled that the entire province was dealing with power outages. Still, a few guests were quick to point out that they had stayed at La Ferme with similar issues before. It seems it’s a chronic problem that the owners have failed to address adequately. Their back-up generator can’t sustain a high volume, meaning as music and large flat-screen TVs run in the central building, the rest of the houses’ power has to be cut completely. Staff assured concerned guests that once the party was over, power could be diverted back to the rooms.</p>\r\n<p>But unfortunately, even then there was scarcely enough power to run the fans, and those only for a few hours. Thereafter we were left without a trickle of electricity. A/C? Out of the question. Fans? Water for showers? Lights to find your way to the bathroom? Better luck next time.</p>\r\n<p>Come morning, those 50 some bedraggled, overheated, partied-out Hanoians crept back to the refreshing blue water of the swimming pool, downed icy beverages, and grumbled over breakfast. A sign was posted in the central room: to compensate for the inconvenience, each guest would receive a complimentary beer at lunchtime, as well as a free 30-minute massage or facial.</p>\r\n<p>I myself went for the facial, and found it took the edge off my own bad mood. After all, when you spend about 50USD extra just for the comfort of air conditioning, and end up sweating the night away in a room without even a fan to push around the stifling air, you get a bit grumpy.</p>\r\n<p>After my cucumber mask, I decided to explore the extensive grounds. My wanderings carried me over stone paths, through shady stands of giant bamboo, to an empty but quaint tea-house, and finally over a rise onto a wide, grassy hillock overlooking a large fishing pond. Each view was more stunning than the last. Coming back down the hill, I noticed a small flock of white ducks paddling around the central lotus pond. Hence the name of the resort, I finally understood, as some French I had seen on a menu once or twice came to mind.</p>\r\n<p>Completing my loop, I returned to the main house.Showers were still unavailable, so as we gathered again with our bags to wait for the bus, most of us were feeling grimy and more than ready to return to our homes.</p>\r\n<p>As for La Ferme du Colvert—well, I personally would love to return and soak up more of that verdant country charm. Nevertheless, I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury experience or with an express need for electricity. The owners, who I understand live in France and are often absent, have a precious gem in their hands.

I also know many will say, "It''s about time," and shrug it off as no big deal. I totally understand both sides so here''s some food for thought, literally.<br />\n<br />\nI swore I''d never eat dog meat. I was repulsed at the idea and often threw scorn at it as totally inhumane and sickening. I thought it was wrong. Dogs are mans best friend, so how can we eat them? They are pets and companions, not food. I looked at it in bewilderment and disgust. I would cringe when I drove past a row of stalls serving dog meat. I was against it and I had reasons to be against it but I am living in a culture different from mine and after much hesitation, I had to re-evaluate my views. Ultimately, a decision was made that it deserved at least one try.<br />\n<br />\nIn celebration for a friend''s birthday, on the table were dog meat, beef, pig tail, and strands of pig penis. I had eaten all of the previously mentioned in the past, excluding dog meat. I promised myself I''d never eat dog but I also promised myself that I would do everything I could to accept and embrace Vietnamese culture in every way possible. <br />\n<br />\nWe were at a large bia hoi (a place unique to northern Vietnam which serves fresh beer at amazingly cheap prices). The place was packed as most bia hoi''s are after working hours, especially during the World Cup. Dish after dish was brought out and eventually the dog arrived. <br />\n<br />\nSomething about knowing it was dog made it very difficult to eat. After some hesitation, I grabbed a piece with my chop-sticks where it stayed for quite some time. I stared at the meat. I thought about it. I wondered if this is really something I could do. I thought about all the strange and interesting foods I''d tried. From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dtinews.vn/news/beautiful-vietnam/opinion/snake-heart-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.html"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">snake to scorpion</span></a>, I''ve eaten many things in my time living abroad that would be very bizarre to me back home. Finally, I shook my head and said out-loud, "There''s no turning back now."<br />\n<br />\nI took the piece into my mouth and focused on chewing; trying not to think about what it was I was eating. Dog meat is very chewy and I found myself chewing longer than I anticipated, thus causing me to think. I thought too much and nearly gagged. After (a lot of) chewing, I managed to swallow the meat. Once I got it down, I started to feel a little guilty but then I began to rethink my stance which I had held quite strongly for so long.<br />\n<br />\nHad I thought it was duck, or beef, or chicken, or pork, surely I would have had no problem chewing away and scarfing it down. I wouldn''t have thought about what I was eating, I would have simply eaten it. However, knowing it was dog made me struggle to get it down. It took concentration just to swallow.<br />\n<br />\nBefore one is quick to condemn the eating of dogs, many things should be considered. First and foremost, this is a long-standing part of Vietnamese culture.<br />\n<br />\nDon''t assume this is something barbaric that only happens in a third-world country. South Korea, a highly-developed nation, regularly consumes dog also. In Vietnam, people don''t grab dogs off the streets or use pets to eat. Many people keep dogs and cats as pets and not everybody in the nation consumes dog, as a matter of fact, most probably do not. In Vietnam, only one type of dog, referred to as "cho ta", is consumed and they are bred on a farm, or at least so I''m told. I''m not advocating eating dog but I certainly have no right to come into another country and tell them not to unless the animal is endangered or illegal to consume, which I am firmly opposed to. <br />\n<br />\nThe point is, before we judge the eating of any form of meat, we need to be careful of hypocrisy. Pigs are highly intelligent animals (and said to be great pets) but most meat-eaters consume pork with no problem. What''s the difference between eating pig and eating dog when both are being bred and slaughtered for consumption? <br />\n<br />\nUltimately, it is another form of meat, raised and bred in the same fashion as the pork, chicken or beef many are so used to eating. It isn''t any more or less humane than eating any other type of meat. Nobody is forced to eat dog and the process is no different from many of the other meats that are consumed worldwide. I''m not sure that I''ll ever try dog again, but I think I gave it a fair shot and have come to realize that just because something is strange, doesn''t mean it''s wrong. After all, this is Vietnam and we eat just about everything.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:52', '2010-12-26 10:23:52'),

Popular beach destinations become too crowded, too built up, too much of a hassle. For those who like to flop around on a quiet beach and forget about the world, the most popular ‘holiday’ beaches become contradictions. Who can feel relaxed on a public holiday if you’re surrounded by thousands of screaming kids and perpetually hassled by vendors? Inevitably, you move on. You seek new horizons far from the madding crowds.<br />\n<br />\nFor now, my tip is Quang Binh province in the ‘north’ of Central Vietnam. South of Ha Tinh and bordering Laos, this is one of the country’s poorest provinces. The average annual per capita income is one of the lowest in Vietnam. But the province’s tourism industry might be the main key to boosting the local economy. The UNESCO heritage site of Phong Nha- Ke Bang cave has flown the flag so far.<br />\n<br />\nNow the province is looking to the white sandy beaches with a great deal of justifiable expectation. The bewitching sight of Nhat Le would certainly convince any developer that this is a stretch of coast worth banking on. But for now, I am also delighted to bask in the peace and tranquility that remains on offer before the bulldozers and master builders roll in. It’s a breathtaking spot and in my humblest opinion one of the country’s most beautiful beaches. Inspired by the prospect of discovering more unknown beaches, I recently decided to explore more of the coast by motorbike. And there is plenty to discover.<br />\n<br />\nIn Quang Trach district, I came across Quang Phu beach, which is popular with locals but yet to be tapped by the tourism moguls. It’s only five or 10 minutes drive from Nhat Le beach and utterly pristine. The water is refreshingly clear. As you swim around, you can see scallops beneath your feet. It’s a wonderful spot to spend a morning or afternoon lolling around in the sunshine, happily contemplating life.<br />\n<br />\nFurther along the coast, you will find Hai Ninh beach and fishing village. The views around are wonderful with imposing mountains to the west and a deep blue sea to the east. After arriving in the late afternoon, I decided to stay until sunset – yes, I’m an old romantic at heart.<br />\n<br />\nThe next morning I headed for Dong Hoi market to enjoy the bustling atmosphere. The fishermen, traders and customers convene over the catch of the day. The market might be the only hectic spot you will come across on the coastline.<br />\n<br />\nThere are already some resorts taking advantage of Quang Binh’s stunning shores and sweeping sea views. The Sun Spa Resort is leading the pack. Set on a picturesque peninsular the resort boasts 234 international standard rooms. The overall design is wonderfully harmonious and tranquil with fern-trunk thatching, private tropical gardens overlooking the ocean, private swimming pools and spacious, elegantly designed rooms.<br />\n<br />\nSun Spa Resort is the perfect gateway to discover the World Natural Heritage Site of Phong Nha – Ke Bang Reserve – though the resort is a natural wonder in its own right, set amidst a spacious 29 hectares of landscaped garden alongside the pristine white sands of Bao Ninh beach.<br />\n<br />\nFurther up the coast, there may be more to come. Development plans have been made for Da Nhay beach, another wonderful spot, 40km north of Dong Hoi. In Vietnamese ‘da nhay’ means ‘the rocks that jump’. As you might guess by that name, this is a rugged, rocky spot but there are also sandy coves for bathing on.<br />\n<br />\nYou can find more modest accommodation than the Sun Spa Resort with rooms available in family-run hotels for VND150,000 to VND200,00. Either way searching the coast for quiet spots to have a dip in the sea is a wonderful way to spend a couple of days (rather than being dragged around by a tour guide). Everywhere in Quang Binh people are hospitable, helpful and happy to share the incredible natural scenery with people from out of town. I guess they want the word to spread.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:54', '2010-12-26 10:23:54'),

It launched a lucrative contracting career.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday Mr. Huy has four workshops and a staff of other ex-convicts—rehabilitation through renovation—mentored by a few elder craftsmen ("still easy to find," he says). He has become a local television personality pitching "a younger generation''s appreciation for our city''s beautiful legacy," though these days he does more business creating reproductions of the old-style buildings than in fixing up the real things.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On numerous leafy side streets within sight of the Citadel—one of Vietnam''s best-protected monuments, though still marked with bullet holes from the war with the U.S.—rusted gates and crumbling balustrades mask lesser-known architectural trademarks of this former royal capital: the handmade, nail-less one-room nha ruong and nha vuon, elegantly landscaped garden houses built for the elite of Vietnam''s Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945). They reflect what Nguyen Xuan Hoa, director of the biennial Hue Festival, calls "a refined style of life that is the essence of Hue."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there''s not even agreement on how many remain, though all counts point to the same trend: the rapid dwindling of a once-ample heritage. When World War II broke out, there may have been as many as 20,000 nha ruong in Hue, says Nguyen Huu Thong, author of a new study of the city''s architecture. As few as several hundred survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the world remembers Hue, a city of 330,000 on the banks of the Perfume River, as site of the Vietnam War''s fiercest battle, in which U.S. troops unleashed their firepower on the Vietcong who seized its ancient battlements during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Now the remaining symbols of peaceful, contemplative life in the country''s cultural capital face a fresh threat: development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, a traditional Hue home is likely to turn up as a transplant in Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, serving as a restaurant or nightclub in front of a more modern structure, or as rooftop gazebo atop one. (The first ones that Mr. Huy restored were for gift shops, though they came from the outskirts of Hue into the city.) While this does keep the historical buildings intact, Hue officials don''t consider it an ideal solution. Where other places in Asia worry about a "brain drain," they speak of a phenomenon that translates roughly as a "house drain." <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder sloping tile roofs (the tiles now often loose), the interiors of the nha ruong are divided by rows of sturdy jackfruit-wood columns and intricately carved braces that demarcate symmetrical vestibules crammed with ancestral photos and altars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut a look inside one shows dilapidation, with bare light bulbs and linoleum replacing lanterns and terra-cotta floors. The main resident, Le Chi Nghe, is a street-food vendor who hardly has funds for restoration, hasn''t been informed of numerous foreign preservation projects and is too suspicious of the government to apply for its loans. Besides, as is often the case, the other owners are spread around the globe, part of Vietnam''s postwar diaspora.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"It would bring shame on us to sell this place of our ancestors, but to agree how to repair it is too big a headache," he says. Despite the common belief that selling is a betrayal of ancestral spirits, owners are more tempted to do so: The value of an intact nha ruong has increased 100-fold over the past decade, according to experts, and the cost of repair is likewise rising. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd for those who actually live in them, selling can be a chance to move out of homes that seem more suited to altars and offerings than air-conditioning, plumbing or privacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"Vietnam is moving from country to city at a quicker pace than any other place on earth," says Paul Schuttenbelt of Urban Solutions, a Dutch nongovernmental organization advising the government''s undermanned Hue Monuments Conservation Centre. Since Unesco declared the city''s imperial monuments a World Heritage site in 1993, international aid has financed the clearing of some illegal buildings and care (however uneven and seemingly haphazard) for the Forbidden City and outlying royal tombs, but Mr. Schuttenbelt says much remains undone: "Hue''s 60 protected historic sites have yet to be centrally mapped, and the next 15-year plan for conserving the city, along with limits on demolition of heritage, has been delayed and remain unapproved."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile development here isn''t yet the boom it is in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi or nearby Danang, Hue nonetheless shows the strains of unchecked urbanization. By some estimates, land prices have tripled in the past several years. Crowded with 100,000 people, the confines of the imperial city walls have sprouted an unsightly hodgepodge of construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross the river, French colonial villas are being bulldozed and tree-cloaked streets are being widened for shopping malls and office blocks, while luxury hotels are flouting height limits recommended to maintain the royal palace''s original sight lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut no element of Hue''s heritage is more vulnerable than the scattered and unsupervised nha ruong—which Mr. Hoa, the cultural festival''s director, declares "no less important than the Citadel and the tombs," explaining that the style dates to the 16th century.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the nha vuon, often similar but set on plots measuring up to 2,400 square yards and studded with lotus ponds, herbal plantings and decorative barriers, they "are organs in the cultural body of Hue," says the head of the province''s Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Phan Tien Dzung. "They are like a small version of the royal palace for each family, and they display a model of harmony between humans and the natural environment."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVietnam''s law dividing inheritance equally among heirs—enacted to uphold the rights of women—generally works against the interests of preservation. Some garden houses'' large lots have been subdivided into tiny areas, often leading to the construction of new concrete houses beside the nha vuon. But the divided ownership can also work to preservationists'' advantage, Mr. Schuttenbelt says: "The lack of consensus among many relatives has also helped keep many of these houses standing."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn ambitious Ford Foundation program launched a decade ago in conjunction with Hue Heritage House, an organization founded under Unesco''s auspices, aimed to encourage preservation by providing repair manuals and "raising awareness of the homes'' values," recounts program director Michael DiGregorio. But it foundered in the face of inheritance and subdivision issues and ran out of funding with barely a single structure saved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore successful was a smaller-scale program that Hue''s sister city of Lille, France, began the same year. It returned some 15 old Hue houses to pristine condition, walls repainted in original ocean blue, termites checked and foundations raised to cope with frequent floods. Plaques on them attest to the support of the "Sénat du France."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn return, residents merely had to pledge to refrain from selling the homes for a profit. They weren''t required to open them to visitors, though many do. The most often displayed is Ngoc Son, a former retreat of a princess now inhabited in messily archive-crammed fashion by Hue''s leading historian, Phan Thuan An.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Kim Long, a green area just beyond the city walls that was the favored neighborhood of scholars and senior government officials, some of the city''s biggest and best-preserved garden houses are readily open for view—for a "donation" of 50,000 dong ($2.60) to the aging residents. A quick survey reveals these were restored by owners themselves, too proud to relinquish the abodes of forebears and too wary of accepting public funds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTourism is a big part of the region''s economy, and Hue''s visitor numbers have slipped as those for Central Vietnam''s other World Heritage site, the port of Hoi An—now a boutique-laden tourist zoo—have risen. With as many as 40 resorts planned along Danang''s adjoining China Beach, Hue faces more challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"World Heritage sites either adapt as living places or become tourist museums," says Urban Solutions head Mr. Schuttenbelt. His advice to Hue is to allow modern adaptations of its architecture while curbing overt commercialization, billboards and big hotels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the Monuments Conservation Centre, its director, Phung Phu, has proposed expanding buffer zones meant to keep modern structures and signs from encroaching on monuments, tougher height limits and an effort to make Hue "a model eco city." He vows, "We must have new policies that meet the challenge of development." But no part of his next master plan has been approved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than any NGO or government initiative, the hope for Hue''s old houses may lie with self-appointed saviors like the youthful Mr. Huy—who says he shares "a natural appreciation for gardens with all Hue people." (His mother fostered it by bringing him "architecture books for me to study while I was in prison.")<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"It''s ordinary people who are showing much greater care for these houses than five years ago," says the crusading ex-convict, adding, "there are not many left and we don''t want the most precious part of our culture to vanish."</p>\r\n<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="center" style="width: 681px; height: 160px;">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor="#cccccc">\r\n            <p style="text-align: justify;"><br />\r\n            <strong>Trip Planner</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Getting There<br />\r\n            There are frequent inexpensive flights of just over one hour from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City on Vietnam Airlines.

The undeveloped island and its gorgeous white sand beaches have been tagged by major investments that are aiming to expand its shaky tourist infrastructure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sand on Quan Lan Beach is stranger than the sand on other beaches I have visited. It''s white, tiny, pure and smooth. The transparent water allows my eyes to gaze at the bottom of the sea where I can watch fish swim around colourful coral.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisitors can stay in bungalows on the beach or with locals in a quiet village. In the future, tourists are bound to discover the gorgeous shores of this island paradise, and its unsullied beaches are likely not to stay isolated for too much longer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the 11th century, Quan Lan had been a centre along the commercial route. In the 12th century, Quan Lan was the first trading port of Viet Nam built under Ly dynasty. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1149, King Ly Anh Tong took this place to set up Van Don town and Van Don trading port in order to speed up commercial relationships between Viet Nam and South East Asian countries. Relics of former trading port have been discovered with traces of ancient architecture, well, and grazed terra-cotta of meters thick to prove that this place used to be a crowded urban. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the fifth and sixth lunar months, the area annually celebrates religious ceremonies to remember the area''s former king, and residents also hold boat rowing festivals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1288, the beach was also the site of the well-known defeat of invading Mongol troops, who were destroyed by General Tran Khanh Du''s army. Tourists in Quan Lan can visit a temple dedicated to the General, where they can learn about the history of the region and the achievements of the commander. The temple''s roof is hidden under pine canopies. Approximately 100 steps lead to the temple''s entrance that is halfway up a mountain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause Quan Lan is a strategically important seaport, the French built a lighthouse on its shores in the 19th century in order to protect the beach and to signal to passing merchant ships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor tourists resting on the beach in evening, the illuminations from the lighthouse look like a twinkling star.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dearth of post-midnight electricity makes night life a wee bit difficult to sustain in this town. During the evening hours, locals and a few tourists stroll along the village''s main street, where sugarcane juice vendors and a few cafes stay open. The only sounds that dare to disturb the island are the melodic vibrations of karaoke bursting from living rooms and local cafes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSa sung (kind of sea worm) is a speciality of the region. It''s used in cooking soup, which helps provide a wonderful taste and adds nutritional sustenance to dishes. Fishing for sa sung with the locals is a popular activity for tourists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"While men in the village go fishing in the sea, we catch sa sung and sell them to tourists and businesses on the main land as our secondary job," says a local woman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no five-star hotels at Quan Lan Beach, but tourists are able to enjoy a pristine atmosphere that has yet to be overdeveloped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:56', '2010-12-26 10:23:56'),

I didn’t give his claim much credence at first, until I stepped foot into the market—known as Cho huyen Sin Ho, and open every Sunday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSituated imposingly on the Sin Ho plateau of Lai Chau province, Sin Ho town is located on the highest peak, over 2,000 metres above sea level and surrounded by verdant mountain ranges and clouds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocals call it: The Roof of Lai Chau province. The small town is also well-known as the second Sapa of the northwest area. But the climate in Sin Ho is even more sour and scornful than that of Sapa. Suddenly, you can be standing in a sea of white clouds, then, just several minutes later, the rain will rumble down like a waterfall. But right after the last rain drop falls, the sun will rise brilliantly and a cool wind will blow over the small town.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt takes me four hours to drive up the zigzagging road from Phong Tho town, at the junction between National Road No. 4D from Sapa and National Road No.12 towards Muong Lay town. The mountain road has been smoothly paved over, but it’s still a slow and winding drive. Therefore, I decide to spend a night at Sin Ho town and wait for the market until the next morning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the late afternoon, Sin Ho town looks small, deserted and gloomy, with simple and sparse wooden houses roofed with dark grey cement tiles and only a few shops and restaurants. It’s lucky that there are several modern guesthouses and mini hotels with reasonable prices. For only VND250, 000 per twin room, I check into the Thanh Binh guesthouse. It’s not an overstatement to say that at such a cost, this is the best hotel outside of Sapa in the northwestern area. It has spacious rooms, good facilities and a friendly staff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Sunday morning, the sleepy town comes alive. From all paths up and down leading to the town centre, waves of tribes people walk or ride horses and motorbikes, all loaded with many kinds of farm products, toward the market. These tribes come from many distant villages up and down the mountains. They are Flower Hmong, Blue Hmong, Black Hmong, Lu, Black Dao and Red Dao, among others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a morning at the market, I take a trekking tour to Pha Xo Lin II village, just three kilometres from the town centre. The village is home to the Dao Khau tribe, also known as the Sewing Dao, or the Black Dao, who wear black trousers richly embroidered with signature flower, tree and star patterns seen on many Dao costumes. They also wear a front hanging black apron with a wide, plain blue band around its outside, together with a plain black turban.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe village is very beautiful and poetic, with dark wooden houses roofed with black stone tiles and fenced in with stone hedges. This season, the peach and mango orchards are ripening in a riot of red and yellow. It’s mouthwatering to walk in the village, where you can take a seat under the fruit trees to enjoy lovely lanterns swinging in the cool winds and their fresh and sweet tastes. Pha Xo Lin village is very famous for its special golden red mangoes, with their sweet taste and jackfruit-like flavour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBesides its delicious fruits, Pha Xo Lin village is a shopping paradise of brocades and embroidery products. It’s common to see Dao women sitting at their thresholds in their front yards or under the fruit trees sewing passionately.

In this role, he established more than ten schools to introduce aspects of the French way of life without damaging indigenous culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDucamp had been investigating a range of investment opportunities from Hong Kong to the French dependencies in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife was good for the men and Dumoutier was already the owner of a row of houses in downtown Hanoi.</p>\r\n<p>He invited Ducamp to join in a new enterprise that both of them knew little about. After a short discussion, the two men got excited by the mere thought of it: Dumoutier provided the houses covering 3,140 square metres and Ducamp put up half a million francs in cash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is how the two men would come to build a first-class hotel fit for any of the world’s major cities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A phoenix from the swamps</strong></p>\r\n<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, Hanoi, the city of lakes, grew rapidly. The French drew up detailed plans for a new town to be laid out beside the old one. Dumoutier had access to the blueprints for Hanoi, which were kept in the government’s planning division.</p>\r\n<p>At that time, Henri-Rivière Boulevard was no more than a narrow track running through marshlands and lakes. Dumotier knew that before long, it would be the new heart of the European settlement in Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEver the opportunist, he quickly snapped up two available lots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the capital of Indochina, Hanoi was receiving an increasing number of visitors who had to be put up in official guest houses, missions or private homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey had the Grand Hôtel near the ‘little’ lake or the Hanoi Hôtel in rue Paul Bert and a smattering of small hostels. However, none of these were truly elegant or designed to meet the needs of the international traveler.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDumoutier was about to change this. He wanted the style of the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo with its huge ballroom and the Adelphi in Singapore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith just 500,000 francs, the two men were able to get it up and running. On the spot where 10 years earlier a small, muddy lake had provided an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, a huge hotel took shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIts façade spanned over 80 metres, making it the largest hotel in Indochina or, as the Revue Indo-Chinise remarked on March 18, 1901, “un immense hôtel”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 1901, the Grand Hôtel Métropole Palace opened its doors to the curious population of Hanoi. A British visitor, Alfred Cunningham, who was one of the Métropole’s first guests, had written in his book, ‘The French in Tonkin and South China’, “The hotel is elegantly furnished, each bedroom has a bathroom and there is a public hall, salon de conversation, reading room. The sanitary arrangements are perfect, and the general accommodation leaves nothing to be desired.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>Limelight</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hotel soon became the rendezvous point for colonial society in the first half of the century. During the boom years of the 1930''s, Hotel Metropole was the social venue for all occasions, including the honeymoon venue for Charlie Chaplin after his secret wedding to Paulette Goddard in Shanghai.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing Vietnamese independence, the new government opted to maintain it as the official hotel for visiting VIP’s. During and after the war years, it became a base for press and diplomats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n90 years after it had risen so gloriously from the swamps of ancient Hanoi, the Thống Nhất (or Reunification Hotel) was closed for the face-lift of the century. As an integral part of Hanoi’s history, the hotel has played host to numerous Kings, heads of state and celebrities since its re-opening in March 1992.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A new morning</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hotel is divided into two wings. The historic Metropole Wing was inspired by classic French architecture with a hint of local touches. The more contemporary Opera wing, which was completed in 2007, was renovated to create a harmonious blend between the historic and modern elements of the hotel. Great care was taken to respect the rich heritage of the site while installing state-of-the-art technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Opera wing is ready to return to its position as a popular address for celebrities, leisure tourists, businessmen and politicians alike.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe centenary Hotel Metropole Hanoi has once again been recognized by two renowned travel publishers: Condé Nast Traveler US and Travel & Leisure, as one of the best hotels in the world.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:59', '2010-12-26 10:23:59');

The first villagers here were all fishermen but they soon discovered that the land here was very suitable for growing vegetable. With skills and experience, farmers here have been producing some of the country’s most celebrated greens, which have been become a trademark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA walk around the village reveals small, green, edible plants spread out in all directions, giving off a natural aromatic fragrance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalking with the farmers here, we learn that it takes a lot of hard work to have such green fingers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We have to learn how to till the land, sow the seeds and then how to nurture the plants,” Manh Hung, an old farmer while wiping his sweaty face, “This work may be easy for farmers in other places but extremely difficult for us here because we do not use chemical boosters and fertilizers."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is also one reason why Tra Que vegetables are being chosen by not only Hoi An’s locals, but also families and supermarkets from neighbouring areas like Danang City, Duy Xuyen and Hoa Vang Districts. They are healthier than those grown using chemicals and provide a distinctive flavor that has earned a loyal following.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Our land here is enriched by the alluvium of the De Vong River,” said Tran Minh Nhu, a local guide who has a large onion plantation. “We fertilize it with algae from a nearby lagoon. That may be the reason why our herbs are so green and tasty.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong the more than 20 kinds of vegetables and herbs grown here are cabbage, colza or rape, celery, kohlrabi, and perhaps the most famous, savoury. Similar to basil and mint, Tra Que savoury is very popular in many restaurants and hotels in Hoi An for its special fragrance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recognition of the local farmers skills, people here all refer to them as “artistes”. Thanks to their special products, the village has become an attractive destination for tourists. It has been a highlight for visitors to Hoi An since the first tour to the village was opened in 2004.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hoi An’s centre, Hoi An Travel Company takes visitors on one-day or half-day tours to Tra Que, which gives them a chance to discover the daily life of farmers and try their hands out at actual farming. Visitors can participate in such activities like tilling the land, sowing the seeds, watering, fertilizing, harvesting and so on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis tour is attracting a lot of people, especially foreign tourists. In recent years, Hoi An Travel has been taking more than 1,000 tourists to visit Tra Que Village annually, gaining hundreds of million of Dong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisitors to the village will be welcomed at two guest-houses before being taken to the plantation by a local farmer to see and join his work. If they stay for a whole day, lunch will be served at the guest house with Hoi An’s special dishes. After that, visitors can relax with a foot massage using medical herbs before saying goodbye to the farmers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"I really enjoy the work as I never have worked on a farm before," shared on Irish visitor joining in a full-day tour with us. “Besides learning the work of farmers in Vietnam, I can relax and do exercise at the same time.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a steady income from both farming and tourism, living standards for residents has improved significantly, all thanks to the humble herb.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:00', '2010-12-26 10:24:00'),

And good-humoured. (How else would you describe a giant, golden, inflated rice balloon with a rice pattycake hiding inside?) Somehow, that buoyant nature has survived in the people and the food through the bloodiest of wars. A grandmother toothily laughs. A translator tells us she’s asking if we understand her babbling baby grandson in English because he’s sure not speaking Vietnamese.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was smitten. Even the city traffic, which seems more like a national suicide pact (motorbikes, bicycles, cars, people, tuk-tuks darting in every conceivable direction without the logic of lanes, traffic lights, or rules of the road) won’t deter me from going back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing from Hanoi in the north to Central Vietnam and down to Ho Chi Minh City (still referred to as Saigon by most locals) and the Mekong Delta, the food changed with the geography and climate which morphs from temperate to tropical.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVancouver’s Vietnamese restaurants only skim the surface of regional variations of food in that country. We don’t see the amazing produce or taste the intensity of herbs or variations of the nuoc nam , the fermented fish sauce, a signature taste in so many Vietnamese dishes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Hanoi, we had to try the one-dish restaurant, Cha Cha La Vong. The dish? It’s called cha cha — monkfish fried with dill, turmeric, rice noodles and peanuts. They bring a charcoal hibachi to the table and you cook the fish and a pile o’ greens yourself. The restaurant has been there for several generations and the staff is said to be gruff (unusual in Vietnam, but the matriarch took a shine to us and came and cooked ours for us in between counting out dongs (Vietnamese currency) at the next table, their evening’s take. It’s grungy (Molly Maids would have heart attacks), but it’s so famous that copycat restaurants have sprung up, messing with your mind. The cha cha was delicious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be unforgivable to wimp out on trying street food for fear of gut-wrenching illness. We searched for ones that came recommended (my neighbour, who’d been to Vietnam a year earlier, recommended a pho seller, for instance).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne night, we went to a place that sold great pork patties and shrimp spring rolls. Gratefully, we sat at a table, not on the plastic toddler stools that Westerners look ridiculous on, at some of these places. The food was good and my stomach inflated like that rice balloon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy husband, however, didn’t want to miss out one chance to try the street pho that our neighbour, Karen, had recommended. I watched in amazement as he went in search of it, sat down with the locals and slurped back a heaping bowl of pho. Mom and son threw enormous cuts of meat to each other, sliced off thin slices and threw slices into steaming bowls. Locals looked astonished when they thought a stranger reached out for my husband’s pho (it was me) and took a big, noisy slurp. It was, despite the optics, delicious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWild Lotus, in Hanoi, is in a gorgeous French colonial building. (The French left behind beautiful buildings and A something of their food culture, unlike the Americans, who left bomb craters.) We followed a marble staircase and passed by a fountain en route to the second-floor restaurant with a modern tropical feel. Slender female servers (they’re all small and pretty) wore ao dai (those silky, side-slit tops) and males wore suits. Astonishingly, main dishes were an average $6 Cdn. Deep-fried prawns bundled in vermicelli, served with plum sauce; grilled sea bass; morning glory leaves, sauteed in garlic; pork loin with cashews, mushrooms, dried chili, spring rolls in shredded rice noodles — and the bill came to about $60 with wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou should use a guidebook because you’ll run into horrid food just like anywhere. We ducked into a nice-looking place for breakfast one morning and “shirred eggs” turned out to be an eggy sauce with a lid of goopy cheese and bits of ham. Yech!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Central Vietnam, at Hoi An (where my husband had the equivalent of a Zegna suit tailored for $350), we ate at a string of food stalls along the Thu Bon River, returning to “Mr. Dong’s” a few times for the “white rose,” a regional specialty of shrimp dumplings in clear rice dough. But the banana pancakes and noodles were just as good. (Dong is also the word for Vietnamese currency, a challenge to say for an inhibited North American.) Breakfast was included at the hotels we stayed in and at Hoi An, we could have had a sumptuous Vietnamese buffet every morning with dim sum-like dishes that changed daily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCafe des Amis came recommended in guide books and was a heck of a deal with seven courses for about $12, but it was most memorable for the owner, a Mr. Kim, decked out in black leather pants and jacket, a smoking bon vivant, strutting among guests, telling stories he must have told a thousand times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA young couple we met from London led us through the dark alleys of Hoi An and to their discovery, a restaurant called Secret Garden, not in guide books. We ended up taking group photos with the friendly staff after a meal of star anise soup, pork and fish tamarind hotpot and pork skewers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Ho Chi Minh City, I’d stand, each morning, at the fourth-floor window of our hotel, looking down at a woman who made rounds on her bicycle, draped with bags and bags of produce, eggs, fish, meat. Women from shops would saunter out, leisurely check out the fare and buy a little bit of this and a little bit of that. (And no, it wasn’t refrigerated.) Then she’d move on, plastic bags rustling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVietnamese supermarkets don’t exist. Food is bought at markets or vendors on the street. The floating markets are very cool. We put-put-putted around the boats early one morning before taking off down the Mekong on a “Heart of Darkness” journey to an eco-lodge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt Ho Chi Minh City, my all-time favourite spot was Quan An Ng, a brilliant idea. Cooking stations circle the perimeter of an elegant French colonial-style restaurant; each one is a stall with cooks making street foods from all over Vietnam. You can walk around, check out all the regional specialties at the stations and point and order or order off the menu. Can they please open one in Vancouver?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most modern Vietnamese meal was at the sleekly modern Xu restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City. A four-course tasting menu was about $27; an eight-course went for $44. The menu features dishes like tuna spring roll and black sesame seared tuna; steamed rice flour roll with fish, bean shoots and roasted shallots; tamarind-braised beef cheeks with pumpkin mash and pumpkin flower; crab soup with boiled quail egg, peanut and chili; scallops with green mango noodle salad and lemongrass dressing. Desserts? Durian cream puff and chocolate caramel tart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had a dramatically memorable dish from along the Mekong Delta. On a bike trip, we had a lunch of elephant ear fish which was deep-fried whole and mounted like a trophy on a wooden stand, dramatic as heck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat I won’t dwell on here is the part of Vietnamese cuisine I can’t bear. Even the thought of a snake farm at one of the towns we biked was enough to send me on a detour. At an outdoor coconut candy factory, I bought some of the taffy-like confections, trying not to look into the eyes of the coiled vipers, trapped in bottles of rice wine, said to invigourate libidos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the same shop, lots of alligator purses, perhaps siblings of the ones we saw in a muddy pond?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut getting back to the good stuff, another unforgettable Vietnamese culinary tradition is their insanely good coffee. It’s intense and delicious, dripped slowly into condensed milk if you don’t want it neat. We brought a few bags home, but I think you have to be Vietnamese to make it so good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd dare I say, I think that to be true of the food, too.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:01', '2010-12-26 10:24:01'),

Tet Doan Ngo is one of the most popular annual festivals in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTet Doan Ngo (or Duanwu Festival according to the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation) is believed to have originated in ancient China. There are a number of theories about its origins. Today, the best and most widely known legend relates to the death of Qu Yuan, a scholar and minister to the King of Chu, in 278 BC. Being unable to advise his King in the war against the Qin, Qu Yuan had thrown himself into the river on the 5th of May according to the Lunar Calendar. Chinese people hold an annual festival on this day to commemorate him. Duanwu Festival is also celebrated widely in Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Vietnam however, few people know about the Qu Yuan legend. People often call Tet Doan Ngo by another name, “Pest Exterminating Festival”, for obvious reasons. The festival also occurs on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month which is the beginning of summertime - a ripe time for pests and parasites. This day is dedicated to getting rid of as many of them as possible. This day is also said to be the death anniversary of National Mother Au Co. (a brief mention of who she was/what she''s famous for would be good to mention)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, Tet Doan Ngo falls on June 16.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the morning during Tet Doan Ngo, children paint their nails red using an extract from a kind of medical herb called lá móng. They rub their necks and navel with some lime juice, and hang an amulet around their neck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe day starts with a special breakfast of fruit and violet rice wine. Strong-tasting fruits such as plums, mangos, and litchi are the traditional favourites. This breakfast, together with the extract of lá móng, lime juice and amulet were considered helpful in warding off bad spirits and diseases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter breakfast, everyone has to take a bath. To prepare for this “activity”, parents boil a big pot of water with different kinds of medicinal herbs, like grapefruit leaves, lemon leaves, bamboo leaves, and basil. The bath is believed to help wash away all heat rashes and pimples as the hot weather sets in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext, while parents are busy preparing a lunch party, children are sent to the garden to help kill all garden pests and to protect the trees. People believe that by taking care of trees on this special day, the orchards will be more fruitful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most popular dish in Doan Ngo Festival is duck noodle. After making offerings to their ancestors, a big lunch party is held in every family home. Children who live and work far away all gather in their parent''s homes for a party. According to custom, the son-in-law will bring two geese, some sticky rice, some green beans and fruits to offer his parents-in-law, showing his respect and gratitude to them. This act is called a “Sêu” offering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some regions, people also give “sêu” offerings to their teachers, doctors, or someone they respect. This custom is encouraged to promote good behaviour and to help bring the community together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter lunch, guests wait for the clock to strike twelve. On the stroke of midday, they head to the garden to pick 100 different kinds of leaves. The leaves picked at this time are thought to have medicinal qualities. They will be dried and used for drinks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf all the festivals held throughout the year, Doan Ngo Festival is one of the most awaited for home-owners. Today, there are also many out-door activities held on this occasion, including:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Fruit Festival celebrated from June 12-17 in Lach Market, in the southern province of Ben Tre, featuring such activities as fruit competition, fruit arrangement competition and fruit crop competition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Fruit Floating Market being held from June 1 till June 16 at Suoi Tien Amusement Park, HCM City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Tour to fruit gardens in Tan Phu Commune, Chau Thanh District, Ben Tre Province</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:01', '2010-12-26 10:24:01'),

An old woman straddles her and, with rhythmic sweeping motions, rubs a silver coin into the exposed flesh. Thuy''s back is covered in bruises – vivid purple stripes extending symmetrically outwards from her spine. On a nearby bed two children are playing cards. In a hammock an old man is snoring. Nobody seems interested in the torture scene being enacted under their noses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActually, this is not torture but an everyday slice of life. When I first arrived I was bewildered by the number of people walking around with grotesque markings on their skin – women with purple bruises running down their necks; shirtless men flaunting the tracery of welt marks across their backs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnlightenment came abruptly and comically. I arranged to meet a pretty Vietnamese girl in a restaurant. In I walked, and there she sat, smiling sweetly, apparently oblivious to the purple blemishes all over her neck. My first thought was: "Lovebites!" I didn''t tell her this, instead gently broaching the subject of her neck ... er … injuries. Whereupon she burst out laughing and initiated me into the world of cao gio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn England, if you have a headache or a pain, you take aspirin. In Vietnam you allow your body to be scraped with a coin, or spoon or similar object. The skin is first lubricated with a balm or oil and the coin is rubbed firmly and repeatedly in a linear pattern until blood appears under the skin. This is cao gio (pronounced "cow yaw"), which literally means "catch the wind". Illnesses are believed to be caused by an excess of wind and cao gio is believed to release the excess wind and restore balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it work? The Vietnamese seem to think so, but, to my sceptical Western mind, it is the patient''s belief in the efficacy of cao gio, plus the therapeutic effect of massaging that are responsible for any cure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCao gio – along with herbalists, acupuncturists, sorcerers, fortune-tellers and priests – is an indelible part of Vietnamese medicine. More than anything, cao gio is a social bond, a link with the past and with your neighbours – a highly visible sign that you are part of tradition and truly Vietnamese. One of these days, I might try it myself.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:02', '2010-12-26 10:24:02'),

Moments of clarity. Moments where I''m transported to the past. Moments where a scene is truly something to behold. And then there''s madness again and the world''s going too fast, and Hanoi''s spreading up and out but it''s not like watching grass grow. I feel that if I don''t get out the way, they''ll be entombing me in bricks and mortar, giving me a lick of paint and setting up a teashop out front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore that happens and before Hanoi completes its total morphing into just another big Asian metropolis minus its distinctive wet markets and street eateries, its corners of crumbling colony, its conical hat-wearing vendors, I want to issue an invitation to anyone who''s reading to visit and eat in Hanoi now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to do that by enticing you with a run-down of Hanoi as a food destination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI purchase sticky rice for breakfast each morning from my neighbor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe live in a labyrinth of lanes in Nghi Tam, a sleepy district of Hanoi on the banks of West Lake. In the shadow of the Sheraton Hotel, our other neighbors concern themselves with either market gardens lined with cumquat trees or ponds and green bottles containing black fighting fish, sold in plastic bags for young men to gamble over. At 6.45am, trade in cumquat bushes and fish is slow. Sticky rice trade is brisk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a round bamboo basket covered in woven rattan mats, she digs a bowlful out, places it on a sheet of clear plastic, spoons on a mix of crushed peanut, sesame seed and salt before wrapping my morning meal in a page of some student’s homework. In years gone by, it would have been a banana leaf. The homework or an old electricity bill is other-worldly enough for me. Hanoi’s food culture is intriguing in unusual respects, even after eight years of residency here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI still bike the streets with wonder at the pervasive nature of food in this city. At any moment, at least one sense is being somehow subtly seduced. It may be a vision of a pineapple seller fanning herself against a fading ochre wall, spiked yellow peel piled beside her. The mournful cries of ngo nong day (hot corn here) or banh bao nong day (hot steamed buns here) intimate that food is available, on two wheels and right by my front gate, mid-afternoon or close to midnight. A hefty whiff on the air seeps up and down the corridors of Hanoi’s old quarter signaling that fish sauce is being used in a cooking process. In late summer, the feel on the tongue of luscious longan flesh coming away from its shiny black marble of a pip is almost erotic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Hanoians, food is essentially fuel but it does dominate its fair share of conversations. A typical lunch in the capital centers around the staple: rice. In this part of the world, it is a wonder this grain does not have a capital letter. Admissions have been uttered to me, by some locals, to the effect that if they don''t get their fill of this stuff for a few days, they feel physically sick, that something is not quite right inside.<br />\r\nStreet fruits Jack fruit<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile an afternoon nap generally follows lunch, evidenced by prostrate bodies on sidewalks, on desks in offices, on motorbike seats with legs dangling over the handle bars, behind market stalls with magazines over faces, it is not long before food comes to the fore again. Afternoons are consumed with heated bargaining over fruit. In the late summer, negotiations are barked over the stunning pink beauty of dragon fruit being sold off the backs of bicycles. In autumn, custard apples, pomelos and persimmons arrive by truck under cover of darkness at the bustling, heaving Long Bien market. They are distributed among an army of pavement pounding and pedaling street vendors in the hours before dawn. In winter, an array of citrus varieties is on offer. In this sub-tropical city, if the seasons cannot be easily detected by the weather conditions, observing the fruit rolling through the streets is an alternative method. If it’s lychees, it must be summer.<br />\r\nDry shrimps Dong Xuan market.</p>\r\n<p>The streets are restaurants, though, as much as they are markets. Walking on the pavements of Hanoi is simply not an option. If it is not a parked motorbike forcing a step down onto the road, it will be a curbside eatery. A million miniature maroon and blue plastic stools and tables litter the pedestrian zones of this city. Two dishes predominate amongst the exhaust fumes and chaos of the Vietnam capital’s roads, streets and narrow alleyways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPho, the most renowned, is a rice noodle soup, traditionally made only with beef and originally from Northern Vietnam. Even though Hanoi is just a few weeks away from its 1000th anniversary, pho''s history is short and scantily documented, The Chinese and the French are said to have influenced this defining dish in Vietnam’s cuisine. The French occupation had much to do with the inclusion of beef in the diet, a meat probably considered extravagant by the Vietnamese at that time because of the contribution of the cow in the field. The Chinese connection can be seen in the use of noodles, ginger, star anise and clove.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever its origins, the Vietnamese have well and truly taken ownership of this dish. While regional variation is rife, the most obvious differences occurring in the south where the noodles are thinner, the stock sweeter and the herbs more abundant, a pho purist would champion the simplicity of Hanoi pho: a clear, well-balanced but beefy broth, hints of ginger and spice evident but not overpowering, noodles flash dunked to perfection, a smattering of herbs and a decent mound of tai, beef cooked rare under the pour of the ladle. Hardly ever prepared at home, due to the complicated and time-consuming processes and the myriad of ingredients required, pho has evolved from what was a special weekend breakfast treat into the comfort food of a nation, available morning, noon and night.<br />\r\nold favourite<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHanoi’s other culinary masterpiece is bun cha. Popular as lunch fare only, every road, street and tiny rabbit warren serves up this dish somewhere along its length. Hand-fan powered plumes of smoke signal a bun cha eatery’s location. This dish is basically meat grilled over hot coals served in a dipping sauce with bun (vermicelli rice noodles) and a tangle of different herbs on the side.</p>\r\n<p>The meat is pork, formed into little patties with garlic and shallots, as well as an egg, fish sauce and sugar marinade. A variation has the patties wrapped in la lot (wild betel leaf), adding a slight zest to the flavour. Pork belly is also utilized for this meal, sliced into a thick bacon-like cut, marinated in the fish sauce potion, caged up in the wire griller with the patties and fan-cooked to well-done, edged with crunchy charcoal. Herbs and noodles are dunked in the bowl of dipping sauce containing the meat feast, acting as a dressing for the greenery and a loosener for the vermicelli. This soup cum sauce consists of the usual suspects: fish sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, lime juice and water. Normally lukewarm, it can be doctored to taste with chili, garlic and pepper tableside. Bun cha is the great Vietnamese barbeque!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNumerous other Hanoi specialties mark the city’s streets, some challenging to western sensibilities and palates. Dog meat (thit cho) is the most obvious example. The traditional seven dish dog spread is reserved for special occasions at certain times of the lunar calendar to ward off bad luck and enliven virility. Pigs’ intestines (long lon) are more routine in the cuisine, enjoyed in rice porridge for breakfast or served among generous sprigs of Asian basil (rau hung que) for lunch. The dipping sauce for both of these delicacies is perhaps the most confronting ingredient in the entire cuisine. Known as mam tom, it has a potent aroma, half petrol and half fish. It is best translated as fermented shrimp sauce and, in my time in Hanoi, I’m yet to acquire the taste, even when the olfactory organ is being pinched with my fingers!</p>\r\n<p>Washing the after-taste away presents no problem. Bia Hoi is draught beer served on the street, pulled direct from the keg, sometimes through a proper tap, sometimes enticed down a siphon by a quick suck of air from the beer-tender''s lungs. It is available all over town, from big halls with huge menus to one keg stools on the pavement. After a meal of dog or intestines and mam tom, a few large tumblers will likely ease the experience into the past. A non-alcoholic alternative is sugar cane juice (mia da); a striking light green beverage extracted from the passing of sugar cane rods through a metal juicer contraption and poured over a half glass of crushed ice. In the oven-hot temperatures of a Hanoi summer, this refreshment momentarily halts the human melt.</p>\r\n<p>My wonder at the epicurean experiences I’ve had in Vietnam’s capital are unlikely to halt. Long after I move on, vivid memories of steam drifting from the simmering pot of an early morning pho seller, of chili and lemongrass marinated pork skewers grilling roadside and of frighteningly tough and unyielding fruit vendors will remain.</p>\r\n<p>Procuring a breakfast of sticky rice from my kindly neighbour will be remembered more as graceful ritual than base exchange.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Places to try some of the dishes mentioned:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPho - see the Hanoi Pho Swoop for 25 different locations throughout the city<br />\r\nBun Cha - 48 Pham Hong Thai, 3 Hoe Nhai, 20 Ta Hien and many other locations<br />\r\nXoi (sticky rice) - Cnr.

Visitors can fish in the river and plough the fields with a buffalo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe homestay service was introduced at the village about a year ago and organized by the community with the Green Future Fund, which supports local people with capital and guidance. The project has a very altruistic side. Many of the families involved used to make a living illegally exploiting the forest around the heritage site for timber and wild animals. The homestays provided the farmers with an alternative means to subsidize their meager incomes. Now, most of the wooden houses in the village have been refurnished to welcome tourists.</p>\r\n<p>Even when you want a break from working the land, a simple bicycle tour will find you retracing the steps of Vietnam’s history. One can follow a winding road past a forest management station and find themself meandering along a section of the historic Ho Chi Minh Trail, witness to many fierce battles during the American War, the scars of which can still be seen today. It is very humbling to look up from the historic trail at the timeless backdrop of mountains, unchanged for centuries.</p>\r\n<p>After about 10km, the trail leads past a steep slope and into an immense field. You will find yourself at a river bank where a boat waits to take you back to Chay Lap. Those who like kayaking can explore the surrounding on a different route. Rowing along Chay River, you can visit Toi Cave and admire the breathtaking beauty of mountain cliffs and catch a glimpse of the many grey Langur (Voọc duoi dai) and other endangered animals and birds that live in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.</p>\r\n<p>A number of tour agents work with the village to promote their homestay service.

Built in 1959, it became a network of tracks, roads, and waterways running from North to South Viet Nam, passing through Laos and Cambodia. It provided logistical support to the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) and the North Vietnamese Army. In the early days it would take about six months to go between North to South, on foot or by bicycles or ponies. Throughout the American War the trail had carried more than one million North Vietnamese soldiers and vast quantities of war supplies to battlefields in the Southern war zones. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we passed by a series of mountains along the Truong Son Range, I was told the Americans had dropped at least four million tons of bombs along the trail during the war. The numbers of Vietnamese deaths and wounded were also in the millions. Aside from Agent Orange, the Americans also sprayed other types of chemical defoliants. In addition, they created rain by seeding clouds, in turn producing mudflows -- attempting to destroy the jungle path. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the 90''s, when Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet authorized the construction of the entire trail with concrete materials. Its width was increased up to four times. The newly built road also became highly beneficial to tribal Hmong families as it enabled them to travel from the remote mountain sites to towns and cities. Many Hmongs could do direct trading with the Kinh people, which is the majority ethnic group in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter nearly four hours of smooth travelling and admiring the beauty of the wilderness, we arrived in Thanh Hoa. There, we attended the ceremony of the 100th day following the re-burial of the 22nd emperor of the Le dynasty, Le Du Tong, who had reigned from 1705 to1729. Like all the 27 Le emperors, Du Tong had been buried in a secret location in Thanh Hoa. Forty six years ago, when a farmer was digging up the soil, he accidentally un-earthed the emperor''s tomb. The government decided to keep the remains inside the National History Museum in Ha Noi for research. When Du Tong was first buried in 1731, his body was embalmed and dressed in 13 layers of silk gowns containing preservatives. Finally, last spring he was returned to Thanh Hoa, with a grand ceremony. His new tomb will become one of the great memorial sites. To prepare for the second burial, the local authorities had to widen the village roads to allow the 400 cars and trucks into the site. On the date of the burial, many young children climbed up into the trees to watch the coffin being lowered into the ground. Overloaded with the children, many branches fell and broke. Miraculously, nobody was injured. The locals said the emperor had protected them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 100th day ceremony was scheduled to begin at 3pm. However, the monks had decided to wait for us as we did not arrive until 4pm. At this ceremony, I was given the rare honor to present a scroll written in calligraphy by a Buddhist monk containing my personal wish to the Emperor''s spirit. He is called "the elder gentleman". Something strange would happen soon. In that same week, I was invited to Dien Bien Phu for the commemoration of the 56th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The trip would take 4 days by road, with stopovers in Moc Chau and Lai Chau. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nguyen Thanh Son, would lead the group. I badly wanted to visit the great old battlefield. However, I had already scheduled another trip to the Mekong Delta, concerning my charity. It would not be possible for me to include Dien Bien Phu. While feeling the anxiety, I made a prayer to "the elder gentleman". To my pleasant surprise, the dates for Dien Bien Phu were suddenly changed and we would leave Ha Noi two days earlier. The revised departure date was perfect for me, as I would be able to make the trip to the Mekong Delta after returning from Dien Bien Phu. Did the "elder gentleman" answer my prayer or was it pure chance? In either case, I felt that some spiritual force had blessed me for having committed myself to the charity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe left the burial site in the evening. On the way back to Ha Noi, we stopped at a little restaurant near a mountain site for dinner. The pleasant waitress served us charcoal grilled wild boar. This was accompanied by fried farmer chicken, steamed fish with green bananas, and boiled wild vegetables. That was an exceptionally delicious meal. We returned to the comfortable car and were driven smoothly along. I enjoyed listening to many heart-felt war songs. The long trail circling the Truong Son mountains was most serene and one could hear the whispering of the night wind. The sky was pitch dark: mysterious, calm, and melancholic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy journey to Dien Bien Phu a few days later included another series of scenic routes and also rough and muddy roads. The group enjoyed various local cuisines, including wild boar and buffalo meat. Early morning the next day we arrived at a hilltop overlooking the old battlefield. The grand ceremony for the deceased soldiers was solemn and powerful. The event was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Buddhist Association. Nearly 100 monks and nuns were present, with a huge crowd attending each day. The great altar was filled with many varieties of fresh fruits, prepared food, and drinks. Lots of beautiful orchids and chrysanthemums were on display. Together with other overseas Vietnamese, I visited the large cemetery of the unknown soldiers. At each tomb, we lit incense for the deceased. One of the most moving aspects of the whole occasion was the consideration shown to the soldiers on both sides of the war who had died for their countries. On our last day at Dien Bien Phu, we went up to General Vo Nguyen Giap''s old headquarters on top of a very steep hill. Climbing was hard physical labor. I wondered about the task of pulling the many heavy cannons uphill. I thought of the thousands of Vietnamese, known and unknown, who had lost their lives at this battle. We owe them our way of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs soon as I returned from Dien Bien Phu, I made a second trip to Thanh Hoa, this time with Brooke Balza, an American documentary photographer. A devoted member of the charity, she wanted to obtain many photographs of the children victims of Agent Orange. They are of the third generation of those originally infected. Witnessing their physical deformity was most disturbing. With the photos, we will hold international exhibitions to raise money in order to build therapy and skill centres in Thanh Hoa and other provinces. During the American War, a large number of young men and women from Thanh Hoa had gone South to join the nationalist forces. Of these, at least 22,000 were infected by Agent Orange. Thanh Hoa itself had also suffered massive bombing raids. In the mid 60''s, when the United States started their seven year campaign against North Viet Nam with "Operation Rolling Thunder", the Thanh Hoa Bridge was a strategic target for repeated attacks. So many B-52 bombers were shot down from this bridge that the proud local residents changed its name to "Dragon''s Jaw Bridge". <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI now anticipate many future trips to Thanh Hoa. And I would love to travel along the Ho Chi Minh trail again. One day I would like to go along the trail all the way to the Mekong Delta. </p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:09', '2010-12-26 10:24:09');

After the grasshopper appetizer, there were choices of grilled goat teat or raw cobra heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was just another typical meal in Vietnam, especially when you''re traveling with Portland restaurateurs Lam Van and Elizabeth Nguyen, owners of Portland''s Pho Van and Silk restaurants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast March, they led a group of seven couples, along with their favorite wine distributor, Holly Wing, on a two-week culinary adventure through Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting in the French-influenced capital of Hanoi, we stopped in Halong Bay to the north; Hue and Ho An in central Vietnam; and finished in Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta. Along the way, Lam and Elizabeth made sure that the meals were a constant -- and sometimes startling -- highlight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Northern Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRooftop restaurant Highway 4 was our first foray into full-contact adventure eating. With crunchy grasshoppers, fried softshell crabs, spicy squid, baby fish and seasoned mountain vegetables, our first meal in Hanoi was one of our best.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with dinner, we sampled a variety of Vietnamese snake wines, which have the smoky taste of a weak Scotch and are essentially the same as Japanese Habu Sake -- with the addition of a fermented snake in the bottle. We also tried scorpion and cobra wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeated on the floor under a teak trellis, with a Buddhist altar behind us and piles of Vietnamese delicacies in front of us, we felt alone in the mountains of northern Vietnam. But the snake wine can make it tough to get off the floor. (5 Hang Tre St., 84 43 926 0639, http://highway4.com)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a day spent touring the Perfume Pagoda outside Hanoi, our second dinner was far more traditional, and one that Lam and Elizabeth were particularly excited about. We enjoyed a late-night dinner at Le Verticale, where we took over the entire third floor of an elegantly restored four-story French colonial villa. With wide plank floors, gentle candlelight and ultramodern dinnerware, the room could have just as easily been in a townhouse in Ile Saint-Louis in Paris as Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrittany native Didier Corlu started Le Verticale two years ago after several years as the executive chef at Hanoi''s Sofitel Metropole. He has artistically melded his native French cooking with the rich flavors and ingredients of Vietnam to produce one of Hanoi''s top restaurants. In fact, the first floor of the villa is an elaborate spice shop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur six-course tasting menu included wild prawns with spring roll and sweet and sour apple, Corlu''s signature ocean escabeche, pan-fried duck liver foie gras with Daikon turnip and tamarind juice, red tuna with citronella and passion fruit, Didier''s own "le Corlu" cheese and soft cake of chocolate and cinnamon. Each course was as artistically presented as it was exquisitely prepared. While we just enjoyed Didier''s handiwork, he also offers cooking classes every Sunday. (19 Ngo Van So St., 84 43 944 6317, http://verticale-hanoi.com)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Central Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hanoi, we headed to Hue, where we toured the remains of the old Imperial Citadel. The palace, being restored, was badly damaged during the Vietnam War, and bullet marks scar much of the stonework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a Royal Hue dinner at Restaurant Royal Park, our entire group dressed in Vietnamese imperial costumes. Peter Bishop and Janet Williamson presided as the Emperor and Empress of the Court. While the "ancient banquet" was not the culinary highlight of our adventures, traditional song, dance and instruments, as well as the elaborate decorative presentation of the dishes, provided a glimpse of Vietnamese royal life 100 years ago. (38-43 Nguyen Sinh Sac St., Vi Da, 84 54 389 7202)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hue, we headed to the resort town of Hoi An, almost as famous for its tailors, who can produce virtually anything overnight, as it is for its beaches. Our group spent several hours at the Yaly tailor (47 Nguyen Thai Hoc, 84 510 391 4995), having suits, saris and caftans custom-made. Hoi An was the perfect place to relax before the excitement awaiting us in Saigon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Southern Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn our first night there, we went to rooftop restaurant 3T Vietnamese Barbecue, which was teeming with young Vietnamese, occasional expatriates and a few other tourists. The roof deck has a retractable roof, and every table has its own small propane-operated grill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first course, we grilled seasoned boar, venison and goat breast to our liking, and then finished our skewers with fermented tofu dipping sauces. While the goat was a little chewy, the venison was absolutely delicious. Charred fresh okra made for a crispy side dish. Smoke engulfed the open-air restaurant, adding further ambience, and heat, to Saigon''s tropical humidity. The meat course was followed by shrimp, which were brought out skewered alive, wiggling and ready to grill. With plenty of ice-cold Vietnamese beer, we spent hours enjoying the smoky rooftop. (29 Ton That Thiep, District 1, 84 83 821 1631)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also spent a day on the famous Mekong Delta, which has been the scene of so many American movies about the Vietnam War. Today, it is a busy commercial waterway and site of fish farming. We toured several of the smaller islands in the delta and sampled the local coconut candy and rice wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReturning from the delta, we had our final dinner in Ho Chi Minh City at the Quan An Bistro, which offered a more traditional colonial Vietnam setting, in stark contrast to most of the city''s sleek modern restaurants. But the food offered the same rich diversity of tastes and textures that are one of the hallmarks of Vietnam.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:10', '2010-12-26 10:24:10'),

The well’s position peaks out at the edge of the ocean.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKing’s Well is over 1 metre in diametre and 6 metres deep. It was built with boulders and its water level is remarkably stable making it very easy to take water from the well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to locals, during rainy season, King’s Well’s water can spill over the top and run into the sea. There are another 3 or 4 water wells but in summer, they are often dried up or mixed with seawater. King’s Well is famous legendary among the local population and has helped maintain the lives of over 22,000 people.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyday, civilians come to the well and take fresh water from it to use yet its water has never dried up. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many folktales and beliefs about the history of the well. One such legend says that Gia Long King had built the well. The story goes that when the King visited the islands lying along the seashore of the central area, he came to Ly Son Island. By that time, locals were coping with a very severe drought. He conducted a rite asking for help from God. After the rite, he was told in a dream about the location where he should dig up a well. The next day, a well was dug up at the place in which he dreamt. After that, people named it “Gia Long well” or “Well from the King”.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another legend says that during the time when Nguyen Anh (is the name of Gia Long King before he regained his throne) was pursued during the Tay Son revolt, he hid on Ly Son Island. During a very hot summer, food and fresh water was running out. He dug many wells but none of them had water. When the lives of Nguyen Anh and his warriors were hanging on the balance, he dreamt about the position where he should dig a well, leading him to dig in this location.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, according to historical records, Nguyen Anh never ever came to Ly Son Island during the Tay Son revolt.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many believe the most likely origin of this well is that it was dug up hundreds years ago by Cham people, a group of people who were living on Ly Son Island. Many central provinces have a “King‘s Well” like this one. They are often positioned near the sea and built with rocks or bricks by ancient people.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Cham people were very knowledgeable about the Chinese art of fengshui, which helped they find fresh water sources in the most unlikely locations.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, no matter how the well came about, its name, “King’s Well”, expresses the high appreciation of people who have used this fresh water source for hundreds of years.<em><br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:11', '2010-12-26 10:24:11'),

The Saigon river it was founded on is still a major transport artery and, over breakfast from the rooftop balcony of our hotel, we watched the waterway come alive each morning with hundreds of boats bearing consumer goods, building materials and people into the city''s frantic heart.</p>\r\n<table width="200" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="left">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="300" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="200" align="left" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/hoapham/012010/20/10/PHN1022020100120101618.jpg" alt="" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><em>A woman riding her bicycle along Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi.

Perhaps because all this activity takes place in a hot, fecund atmosphere of incense, drains and street food, HCMC feels more visceral than sanitised cities such as New York or London.</p>\r\n<p>While the new high rises and recently opened international luxury brand outlets might point to Vietnam''s possible future, old Saigon and the past are never far away. The Vietnamese refer to the conflict fought between 1964-75 as the American War and many of HCMC''s most popular attractions are linked to those events. The War Remnants Museum is a sobering and gruesomely graphic testament to the inhuman carnage of the war while, an hour or so outside the city, the Cu Chi tunnels, an underground wartime stronghold, offer very definite clues as to why the Vietcong were the eventual victors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny people who are prepared to live and fight in a maze of tight, booby-trapped tunnels for 20 years have a level of determination and tenacity which counts for far more than sheer firepower.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter crawling through a sweaty, airless, 20-metre section of the tunnels, which had been especially widened for westerners, I had had enough. At its peak, the sprawling subterranean complex may have sported hospitals, dormitories and even dance floors but living there is almost unimaginable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 700 miles north of Saigon, the capital Hanoi is more elegant than its thrusting southern counterpart but it is still a long way from sedate. Once colonial France''s administrative centre in Vietnam, parts of Hanoi boast boulevards and yellow painted townhouses and look as though they have been dropped in from Paris. Although Ho Chi Minh''s mausoleum, where the Vietnamese queue for hours to see the embalmed remains of their former leader, owes more to Moscow''s Red Square than the Champs Élysée.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there is more fun to be had in the 36 Streets area of the old quarter. Dating back to the 13th century, this warren of streets was the focus for the city''s trades and merchants and each street had its own speciality. Even today, there are entire streets dedicated to selling padlocks or towels or mysterious dried roots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe perched on little stools at a crossroads pavement bar in the old quarter and supped 15p glasses of draught beer while snacking on dried squid heated over a charcoal brazier. Every now and then the police would come along and order all the stools to be moved off the road. Naturally, as soon as they were gone, all the stools moved back into the road with predictably chaotic consequences for the streams of mopeds passing through.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven at 6am, Hanoi has a bit of pace to it. In the centre of the city is the Hoan Kiem Lake, home to a mythical turtle. By night, the lake is ringed with young, courting couples. Not long after daybreak, it is surrounded by folk doing Tai Chi, playing badminton or keepie-up with a shuttlecock in the city''s cool morning air.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutwith the cities, the pace slows even if the day still tends to start early. From Hanoi, we took the sleeper train to Sapa, an old hill station close to the Chinese border. Sapa is an increasingly popular base for trekking in the surrounding mountains. It is also close to the tiny town of Bac Ha, which is notable for its Sunday market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA social affair as much as a chance to trade, it attracts tribes such as the Black H''mong and Red Tsao from all over the surrounding countryside. Many of the women still wear traditional dress. We pitched up about 7am, around the same time that the locally distilled rice spirit starts being decanted from its five-gallon containers. As well as offering the chance to catch up with neighbours from across the valley, the market is like Tesco''s, B&Q and a grooming parlour all rolled into one for the locals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverything is for sale at Bac Ha, from ploughs to ponies via python fat which looks like clusters of fat broad beans and is, apparently, good for skin burns. Locally grown tobacco sits in mounds along with pipes for customers who want to try before buying. Piglets are pulled squealing out of sacks. Water buffalo are prodded and haggled over while dogs are on offer as both pets and for the pot. In one corner, four or five barbers had hung their mirrors on a wall and customers were having al fresco haircuts. My beard was a prime target which, happily, I managed to keep intact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the mountains of the north-west are an anthropological gold mine then the beaches of Vietnam are, for the most part, virgin territory for tourism. With over 1,000 miles of coastline, Vietnam has some stunning beaches, most yet to see the glint of a developer''s eye. Yet its most valuable maritime asset for tourism is not a beach but the stunning Halong Bay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Unesco world heritage site, it consists of 3,000 limestone islets in the Gulf of Tonkin. Covered in dense green vegetation, they soar up out of the sea in fairy-tale clusters. They are riddled with caves and also play host to a floating village of fishing families, complete with a floating bank and school. Of course, even several miles out to sea, Uncle Ho is still around in the form of a picture which beams down at the schoolchildren from above the classroom blackboard. We did an overnight trip around Halong Bay on a beautifully fitted out junk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a seafood dinner, we fished for squid using a lamp and watched the moon cast a glow over the islands. Gently bobbing on the waves, hundreds of miles from the honking motos of the mainland, it was our most peaceful night in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuch tranquillity couldn''t last. I woke the next morning and looked out of the porthole onto a flotilla of row boats all manned by women eager to sell their first tourist souvenir of the day. No matter what time of day or where you are in Vietnam, it is always open for business.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:13', '2010-12-26 10:24:13'),

By Kim Mi-ju.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Last April, I finally had a chance to get a glimpse of the country where my maternal grandfather fought in the Vietnam War. Based on the stories my grandfather told me while I was growing up, I arrived in Vietnam expecting to see evidence of the war. Instead I was surprised to see how modern the country is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut honestly, the thing that really impressed me was the food, and the bakeries in particular. Although we have bakeries in Korea, the coffee and bread in the bakeries of Vietnam overwhelmed me with their flavours, a mix of tastes and textures from France and Asia, surely a remnant of the country’s colonial past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was in Vietnam at the invitation the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and Asia Europe Foundation to report on an Asia-Europe Meeting workshop that took place from April 28 to 29 in Ha Long Bay in Quang Ninh Province in the northeastern corner of Vietnam. At the workshop, ASEM workshop participants agreed to forge stronger ties through cultural diplomacy linking Asia and Europe.</p>\r\n<table width="200" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="left">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="301" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="166" border="0" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/052010/20/15/1920584920100520154833.jpg" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td style="text-align: center;"><em>The sunset over Ha Long Bay. </em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width="300" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="424" border="0" alt="" src="http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/052010/20/15/1920591720100520154834.jpg" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td style="text-align: center;"><em>Passengers fill their plates with food from the sumptuous buffet offered  on the cruise around Ha Long Bay (above) before going out to enjoy the  view on the deck (top).</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the last day of the workshop, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry took us  on a cruise of Ha Long Bay, which covers 1,553 square kilometers (600  square miles) and has 1,969 islands. After the 10-minute ride from the  Halong Plaza Hotel where we were staying we arrived at the pier and  boarded a waiting cruise ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other passengers and I sat  down at tables set out on the deck and were treated to a feast that was a  mixture of Western and Asian cuisine. Around us, thousands of limestone  islets rose out of crystalline emerald waters that glistened in the  sun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPham Sanh Chau, director general of the department for  cultural relations and Unesco under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  Vietnam, said Ha Long Bay is the first World Heritage Site in Vietnam.  Unesco recognized it as a World Heritage Site in 1994 and again in 2000  in recognition of its natural beauty and geological value.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Ha  Long Bay deserves to be named as one of the seven new wonders of nature  because it’s like paradise. There is nothing like it anywhere in the  world,” Chau said. “It’s not an area just for tourism. It also serves as  buffer zone against climate change. It’s rich in marine biodiversity  and many scientists say this should be a geological park.”</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As we sat back with our plates full of food, fishing boats large and small passed us on their way to their next catch. People exclaimed in excitement when they saw a small tent set up on the waters of Ha Long Bay. The tent, we learned, had been built to accommodate fishermen in need of a break or a place to sleep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur trip around the bay was nothing if not idyllic, but our tour guide explained that tourists who visit the area usually take overnight cruises to Ha Long Bay. The cruise starts with lunch aboard the ship and continues with stops at various caves for kayaking and swimming. Guests then sleep on the boat that night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of my tight schedule, I had to return to my hotel that night and wasn’t able to take advantage of what sounded like a lovely diversion, but before I did I took a tour of the boat’s lower deck, where the sleeping rooms are located. The rooms are cozy and designed to accommodate two people. Each one is fully furnished with a bed, sofa, shower booth and toilet, just like in a hotel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough my journey to Vietnam was short, I picked up a few tips for my next trip that I’d like to share. First, you don’t have to set an alarm because there is an endless stream of honking motorbikes whizzing by every morning in Hanoi and the noise is enough to force your eyes open. Most Vietnamese people start the day early and most offices open at 7:30 a.m.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, you need to be extremely brave when crossing the street. There are no street lights like the ones you find in other major cities. When you try to wade into the traffic that is rushing by, drivers of cars and motorcycles swerve around you without slowing down. On my first day in Hanoi, I stood on the street for 10 minutes waiting for the right time to cross when I finally found a group of Vietnamese women intent on jaywalking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, although the traffic is insane, make sure you stroll around the city on foot. This is the best way to experience a typical day in the life of the Vietnamese people. Women balance poles laden with heavy baskets of vegetables and flowers on their shoulders, passing people who squat on the sidewalk or sit in plastic chairs, sipping tea and eating pho (beef noodle soup) at outdoor food stalls. This is where you can feel the energy of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are planning a trip to Vietnam, I recommend you go to Hanoi first, take a tour of Hoan Kiem Lake and the Old Quarter and then take the overnight cruise of Ha Long Bay. There are travel agencies that arrange rides to the bay from Hanoi in the morning, which takes nearly four hours by car. The cruise starts at noon and the price of the overnight cruise starts at $120.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:16', '2010-12-26 10:24:16'),

Family lore was rooted in colonial Algiers, where three generations of Gregoris had lived until Algeria’s war for independence forced their return to France in 1961.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I was raised in a family where the past took place in a dream country that didn’t exist anymore,” she said. “As an adult, I wanted to find it, and recreate it for my children.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter stints in Paris, Los Angeles, and Nevis (of which she’s also a citizen), in 1992, Ms. Gregori McKenzie, 46, settled here in Vietnam, later establishing Song, an environment-friendly line of casual wear and home linens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it took 11 years before she found a home where she could recreate her family’s roots. And surprisingly, it was a dimly lit, termite-infested, 40-year-old property on the Saigon River in An Phu, an affluent enclave of expatriates about a 20-minute drive from the city center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It was a small, shabby house,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said. “But there was just all this river everywhere. It had the best location.” She signed the lease the same day, paying $1,500 a month in rent. (Most foreigners rent in Vietnam, as there are restrictions on owning. It is also common to pay in United States dollars.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA three-month, $60,000 renovation transformed the two-story, 940-square-foot structure and its fifth-of-an-acre grounds into a lush, barefoot-friendly haven for her twins, Tara and Aubrey, now 17 and in boarding school, and her husband, René Tayeb, 49, Song’s managing director. The family also includes two dogs, Kabul and Beirut, three cats, and 11 birds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Gregori McKenzie’s environmental ethos coupled with her affinity for the past sent her contractor to the city’s French colonial-era warehouses, many of which were being torn down, to salvage materials. “I wanted the feel of an old Vietnamese country house,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHoles were cut into the home’s facade and filled in with mismatched shutters and windows taken from the warehouses. Their peeling frames left, as the French say, “dans son jus,” or as-is, while beamed wooden panels replaced the plastic ceilings and walls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntiques bought in Vietnam and Cambodia — a bow-legged side table, curvy Art Deco armchairs, carved platform beds — dominate the small rooms, while contemporary Vietnamese paintings and family photos jostle for space with geckos that scale the walls. (A fragrant homebrew of lemongrass-mint-lavender essential oils keeps the place bug-free.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe French doors that replaced the back wall open up onto an expansive stone-and-wood terrace with panoramic river views, where meals are served under broad-leaved banana trees and towering palms. “As much of life as possible takes place outside,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVietnam’s plentiful jackfruit trees inspired the home’s exterior, which was repainted a chartreuse, or jackfruit green, blending in with the verdant tropical garden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Gregori McKenzie added two extensions that doubled the living area: a 270-square-foot outdoor, stone-tiled kitchen and two 430-square-foot, self-standing, thatched-roof structures — one a study/TV room and the other a bathroom. Both were built from wood salvaged from a century-old wooden home of a friend.

The coffee they drink is Vietnamese – brewed French style, of course – but the jackfruit and mango they chew on set this scene apart from anything you will see in France. This is definitely Asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s an arresting moment, typical in the Vietnamese capital, which is celebrating its 1,000th birthday this year and manages to retain its old-style appeal despite the passing years and the pressure to modernise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has all the dirt and traffic of a developing world city but combines bustle and calm in a way similar to that of a working French town in a wine region. Hanoi offers an appealing combination of gritty Vietnamese street life and relaxed postcolonial ease.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSitting on the veranda outside the Metropole hotel, one of Asia’s most famous addresses, you can check out a vintage Citroën from the 1930s and a rickshaw. Four years of renovation of this hotel, now operated by Sofitel, have sharpened its appeal but left its heritage intact. For a few delicious seconds you can imagine Graham Greene witnessing a continent in transformation, soon to re-create this vision in an enduring work of art like The Quiet American .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe writer stayed at the Metropole – which occupies the same space in the city’s mental landscape that the Shelbourne Hotel does in Dublin – Charlie Chaplin had his honeymoon here, and more recent arrivals include Robert McNamara, John F Kennedy’s secretary of defence and the architect of the Vietnam War, whose relentless bombing campaigns brought sorrow, and a steely resolve, to the hearts of the citizens of what was then the North Vietnamese capital. Many of the legendary Vietnam War correspondents filed their stories from here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first eight centuries of its existence Hanoi was a Chinese city, and you can still sense the Chinese business ethic in the way people hustle here. This is also evident in its focus on education – the first Vietnamese universities were founded here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally called Thang Long, it was renamed Hanoi in 1831, and after it became a French protectorate, in the 1880s, Hanoi was transformed into a French city, capital of the French Indo-Chinese empire. Army officers from Paris left an enduring bootprint in the solid, elegant edifices and sweeping boulevards that make Hanoi a refuge for those seeking a sense of Montpellier and Lyons to match the fascination of southeast Asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are lots of ways to get around Hanoi, and motorbike drivers offering you a route through the city’s sclerotic traffic channels regularly approach you. Many are simply keen to practise their English and are not on the make, but it’s sometimes hard to tell when you are being hustled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt an intersection near the Hoan Kiem Lake, in the Old Quarter, the sound of motorbikes idling is like the anticipatory moments before a Grand Prix. Tensions are high, and a motorbike bumps into a scooter, toppling a row of five bikes. There are no outraged recriminations, however, or even an exchange of telephone numbers. A young woman on the pillion of the aggrieved party’s scooter is concerned about her heels, but that’s about the extent of it. Road rage is not a big thing in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaxis and cyclos abound, but to get a sense of Vietnam’s capital and second-largest city it’s probably best to walk. This is not always easy to do, as this is still very much a city in the developing world, and pavements tend to trail off into gutters or, increasingly, building sites.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the roads of the Old Quarter, bars selling bia hoi – or light, fresh beer – jostle with new art galleries for space, each building’s address marked out on small plates with white numbers on a background left by the French.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere you can find pretty much anything you would ever need, from knock-off luggage to high-end designer clobber. The Hanoi Gallery offers reprints of stirring, beautifully worked propaganda posters, which help tourists understand how Vietnam, despite its southeast Asian tranquillity and poise, is underpinned by a toughness that has never been tamed, despite military efforts by France, Australia, the US and China in living memory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will still hear bitterness about the decision of Richard Nixon’s government to give the go-ahead to the “Christmas bombing” of Hanoi. From December 18th to 30th, 1972, waves of American B-52s dropped 40,000 tons of bombs on the mostly evacuated city. Although Washington DC said it had to be done, the world’s reaction did a lot to turn public opinion against the Vietnam War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s wrong to dwell on the Vietnam conflict when in Hanoi, however, because people are keen to move on and focus on the way the city is turning into an Asian destination to compete with Thailand and Malaysia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the same time there are plenty of places to visit if you want to see the Vietnamese side of the conflict. Hoa Lo prison, infamous as the “Hanoi Hilton”, is still there, although much of the jail has been knocked down in recent years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe “Maison Centrale” sign over the door has struck fear into the hearts of generations of prisoners. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, spent some of his five and a half years as a prisoner of war there, and his flight suit is still on display. The Hanoi Hilton is so infamous that the current Hanoi Hilton is called the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel, to make sure there is no mix-up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best time to come to Hanoi is in the autumn, when the cay hoa sua trees blossom. The winter is cold and humid, the summer hot and damp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a southeast Asian city it’s remarkably low-rise, but there are plans afoot to dramatically expand its financial sector, and this will lead to skyscrapers. This is a good time to go to Hanoi before it catches up with the rest of the world – and loses a lot of charm in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo there Where to stay, where to eat and where to go in Hanoi city <br />\r\n<br />\r\n5 places to stay <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSofitel Legend Metropole. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n15 Ngo Quyen Street, 00-84-4- 38266919, sofitel.com/asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince its refurbishment this colonial-style landmark hotel boasts 364 rooms, three restaurants, three bars, a swimming pool and a high-end spa, among other attractions.

It''s impossible for us to whip the horse since we have to use both of our hands to control the horse and keep our balance. As easy as this may sound, it''s not easy to do.

The race this year is going to be held on a larger scale. It is estimated that over 150 horses will participate in the march before the race and about 100 will compete in a 1,500 metre race.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe horse race is an annual event of Bac Ha District in response to the tourism program of 3 provinces: Lao Cai - Yen Bai - Phu Tho. It has been considered a highlight tourist attraction.

A day or two, and all you see are the thousands of cliffs jutting out of the lagoon-colored water and nothing else. You forget which way’s east and west, and living on a houseboat with pet dolphins could easily be your reality.<br />\n<br />\nWe stopped on one island and spent the night in a hotel where we had a group dinner with the rest of our boat. Vietnamese like to be in charge, have things done a certain way, and don''t understand independence, so we didn''t get away with trying to hide away in our room enjoying some solace when dinner was served. It made me feel like I was on a cruise vacation where every minute of an itinerary is planned for you.<br />\n<br />\nAfter spending so much time in Thailand, “the Land of Smiles,” I found a lot lost in the translation with the Vietnamese. The language already sounds aggressive, and their body language and facial expressions tend to be serious and dominating. I felt like I was getting yelled at when someone was asking how dinner was, and the feeling went way beyond the obvious American guilt for Vietnam and our role in their history.<br />\n<br />\nWe did a hike into the jungle and took in panoramic views of absolute beauty. There were the usual colorful birds and monkeys as we trekked behind our sandal-clad guide in hiking boots and moisture-wicking shirts in a way that made us feel like typical tourist Americans.

Ten years later, the government opened the Hotel du Parc across the road to meet the increasing number of tourists and hunting enthusiasts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, the two hotels comprise one complex under the same management. Guests of the delightful four-star Mercure Dalat du Parc have access to Sofitel Dalat Palace''s tennis courts, gym and bars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sofitel Dalat Palace has a mere 43 rooms over two floors.

The old village was located along the river bank of the Rao Cai River. Hundreds of small streams from Truong Son Range gather here in this huge river, a river that has supported the life of its locals for generations. However, it can also be wild and raging bringing great danger to people during the rainy season every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the early twentieth century, a dam was expected to be built by the French in Vietnam, but due to World War II and later the Indochina War, the construction was stopped. Finally, on March 26, 1976, when Vietnam was reunified as one nation, the dam was built and completed by Vietnamese irrigation companies. It was named Ke Go and put into use on February 3, 1988.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKe Go Lake is located in the area of 3 districts; Cam Xuyen, Ky Anh and Huong Khe. The lake is a large irrigation work with the water volume of 350 million cubic metres, enough water supply for almost 17,000 hectares of rice distributed in districts Thach Ha and Cam Xuyen, Ha Tinh Commune and north of Ky Anh District. At 30 kilometres in length, the lake also provides an abundant source of food supply for the locals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs well as its practical use, the lake is a highlighted feature of the Nature Reserve. The reserve is the largest among its kind in the central area of Vietnam, covering a natural area of 35 hectares with many timber trees that are listed in the Vietnam Red Book such as green ironwood, meranti, red-wood, and frankincense. The rich and diverse flora of the reserve is representative of the flora in northern Vietnam, South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Himalayas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUntil now, 364 vertebrate animal species have been found in the Ke Go Nature Resrve. White-tailed wattle pheasant, one of the three endemic pheasant types of Vietnam, is currently at risk of extinction. Among 47 mammal species here, 18 were recorded in the Vietnam Red Book and world Red List. Ke Go Forest is home to many beautiful and different types of flowers such as magnolias and orchids. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lake also has numerous oasis.

When the Nguyen dynasty chose Hue as its capital, the development of  pagodas and temples there had already made significant advancements and  were second only to Thang Long (Hanoi).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this fact, the Buddhist culture of Hue still holds many mysteries and is still largely unknown to outsiders. One reason for this is that travel agents only organise trips for visitors to see the pagodas scenery and architecture, not to explore the culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 30 speeches followed by discussions with practical ideas focusing on the theme "Hue Pagodas and Tourism" took place at the "Buddhist Cultural Relics and Tourism Development of Hue Conference", held on May 7 in Hue City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the conference, researchers discussed many pros and cons and many differing possibilities, with the aim of determining whether spiritual tourism could attract visitors on a large scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to researcher Nguyen Phuoc Bao Dan, Hue pagodas were classified into two types, small and simple ones placed deep inside the forest and grand ones decorated in sophisticated style. However, from the space, to the architecture, to the decoration style, Hue''s pagodas are in harmony with nature, giving it a strong advantage in regards to tourism.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon a visit to one of Hue''s magnificent pagodas, visitors will have an opportunity to taste vegetarian dishes that use freshly grown vegetables and fruits from the pagoda''s garden. After the main meal, desserts such as cakes and sweet soup hand-made by Buddhist nuns and monks are served. At the end, visitors can converse, drink tea and meditate among the monks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA complete tour that consists of sight-seeing, cuisine tasting and meditation at Hue pagodas as mentioned above, according to Ton Nu Khanh Trang''s research, would likely make visitors feel relaxed, comfortable and tranquil during their trip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNguyen Dac Xuan, a scholar of Hue studies, said that since the end of the nineteenth century, the French people had begun to organise tours to Hue and one of the highlights was visiting the city''s numerous sanctuaries, shrines and mausoleums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many tourism guidebooks by Marcel Monnier, Ph.Esbérhard (France), the information he provided for readers everywhere on Hue pagodas attracted major interest. During the twentieth century, specifically after Vietnam''s Reunification, pagodas have become must-visit destinations for all tours to Hue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany ideas were introduced, and one of them, "Hue Buddhism Musical Festival", would allow visitors to actively take part in Buddhist rituals, appreciate the artistic value of Hue''s pagodas, traditional music and bring peace to their own soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt present, Dong Duong Commercial Trading Travel Company has adopted this special feature on their "Travel for Peace" tours, which include sight-seeing, conversing and eating vegetarian meals at Dong Thuyen, Ba La Mat pagodas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"Travel for Goodwill" tours aim at meeting and sharing stories with needy children and helpless elderly living in Dus Son Pagoda. The idea has attracted a large number of visitors both in Vietnam and from overseas to come and visit Hue''s pagodas. There are also other tours that allow visitors to see how the Buddhist nuns hand-make their sauce, breads, cereals and incense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Nguyen Huu Thong, the head of the Vietnam Art and Culture Institute in Hue suggested that tours to old temples located in the villages could also be arranged. "The temple as the main destination along with the beautiful and natural rural settings of the villages would create an important opportunity for agricultural tourism and folklore tourism to develop. Tourists will be able to explore many traditional and special characteristics of Hue villages themselves," Thong added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn response to what could possibly be done to attract a large number of visitors to Hue''s pagodas, Dr. Tran Duc Anh Son, Deputy Director of Da Nang Institute for Socio-Economics Development stated, "We should consider using one of the biggest Buddhist festivals in Hue as a lever to attract tourists. The "Quan The Am" (Avalokitesvara) Festival (held on June 18 -19) could be turned into a significant cultural and religious event that is held annually."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Nguyen Dac Xuan suggested developing a "Spiritual-tourism Festival" project, in which he set out the content, purposes, members, and organisation methods for a special Buddhist festival that could be held every two years during the odd-numbered years of Buddha''s birthday (full moon April).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to statistics from Thua Thien - Hue Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2009, the province welcomed over 1.5 million visitors and received more than VND 700 billion (USD 36 million) in revenue.

With the aim to fill up their travel time, visiting the pagodas has only been a minor feature included in tours.<em><br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:23', '2010-12-26 10:24:23'),

In fact, the course’s signature hole — the par-3 16th — backs right up against it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“No doubt that view east from 16 green — of the coastline, the ocean, the Cham Islands just offshore — is going to slow down play,” said Howie Roberts, general manager of Danang Golf Club. “But I’ll be shocked if anyone complains. It’s a photo opportunity if there ever was one.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the breathtaking 16th, the minimalist Dunes Course features 17 more holes that could just as easily be lifted and placed in Australia’s Sandbelt region or along the British coastline — the only other sites where Norman has attempted such compelling modern links.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn fact, the par-5 10th might be even more dramatic, for the way it snakes between some of the highest dunes on the course and is angled toward the iconic Marble Mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We had a respected golf writer here a couple weeks ago who compared his round to a great song,” said Roberts. “’You just don’t want it to end,’ he said.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCredit that feeling to Norman, whose architectural chops are the result of his years of success as a world-class playing professional. He won two British Opens, finished in the top 10 of Major tournaments 30 times and held down the No. 1 ranking for an astounding 331 weeks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1987, the astute Aussie took his profound knowledge of the game and made the official jump into the design profession. He formed Greg Norman Golf Course Design (GNGCD) and the rest is history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past 22 years, GNGCD has created more than 70 courses on six continents and established a reputation for imaginative designs that acknowledge golf’s traditional origins and the landscapes on which it has been played.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDanang Golf Club is the latest beneficiary of that approach. Set amid 260 hectares of tropical linksland, the Dunes Course was crafted in the spirit of the world’s most recognizable links including the Moonah Course at The National in Australia and Doonbeg in Ireland — GNGCD designs that rake in awards for their creativity, quality and environmental harmony.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the addition of Danang Golf Club, the Central Coast solidifies its status as a bona fide golf destination. The Dunes Course gives the region two tracks, including the Colin Montgomerie-designed Montgomerie Links next door. A third layout, by three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo, will soon break ground next to a bay less than an hour north of Danang.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen complete, Danang Golf Club will also feature a 3,800-square-metre clubhouse by renowned Australian architecture firm HASSELL; a comprehensive, technologically sophisticated golf academy; four- and five-star hotels; and multiple residential enclaves totaling up to 300 luxury homes.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:23', '2010-12-26 10:24:23'),

At that time, locksmithery was grouped together with such industries as coppersmithery and woodprinting which were widely popular trades for hundreds of years. Over time, locksmithery has gone through its ups and downs but it still has its place in the everyday life of Vietnamese people.</p>\r\n<p>Walking through the streets of Hanoi, very often you can come across a locksmith’s stand occupying a small place on the pavement. Almost all streets in Hanoi have one or two of such stands but the busy Luong Van Can is probably considered the locksmith street. With only a small box containing essential tools like pliers, a hammer, files, all kinds of keys, and a key-copying machine, a locksmith stand quietly exists among other simple stands such as those of a bicycle repairer, a shoes repairer, or a xe om waiting for guests. Stepping into their world, one can learn many interesting stories.</p>\r\n<p>I had chance to chat with Nguyen Ba Lan, one of the most famous locksmiths in Hanoi, about his life-long career. Lan was once famous for unlocking safes and strongboxes in all embassies and agencies in Hanoi. Starting this work when he was 12, the old artisan had many interesting stories to share. “To learn this job, you need time, caution and patience, but if you want to follow it as a career, you must have a pure conscience,” he said. “Because with just a little too much curiosity, it is very easy for a locksmith to become a thief." The old locksmith smiled when recalling a story from about ten years ago: A strongbox in the Embassy of China was stuck. Seven locksmiths from China had been invited but nothing changed after 12 days. Then he came and solved the problem in just 10 minutes. Skillful and honest, Lan was famous and trusted by many embassies and agencies, both local and foreign. “The Ministry of the Interior had invited me to work full-time for them but I refused because I had many other clients and especially, I had a small workshop with more than 10 understudies trying to learn the trade,” the retired artisan recalled.</p>\r\n<p>In the past, without assistance of machines, good locksmiths depended entirely on the skill of their hands. When making a new key, they meticulously filed the rough draft following the cog of the old one. To be able to solve some other complicated tasks like unlocking safes, boxes or repairing locks, they had to accumulate experience for many years.</p>\r\n<p>Today, however, with the help of key-copying machines, a new key is done in few minutes with high fidelity. Tong Viet Ha, a 15-year-experienced locksmith revealed that when hearing about the machine, he immediately bought one at VND6 million and it is helping him increase productivity greatly. These machines can work on all kinds of keys, even keys for some luxurious cars like Mercedes, Lexus, etc. “A modern locksmith should have 4 kinds of machines to make different kinds of keys. We always have to update new techniques from lock makers so as to treat the most complicated and safest locks,” Hoang said, “However, sometimes machines cannot replace the hands. For example, in the case of losing a key, locksmiths must use their skillful hands together with experience."</p>\r\n<p>The price for making a new key normally starts from VND4,000 for a simple one goes up with the more complicated ones. Locksmiths also earn money from repairing and unlocking services.</p>\r\n<p>Besides these stands, we can also see many “mobile” locksmiths. They have no machine or stand. With some acceptable skills, and a box containing essential tools, they can start going around crying “Sửa khoá đi (Do you want to repair lock or make new keys?)." Such “mobile” locksmiths are not difficult to find in Hanoi. “When I started this job, it was the best way to make money as well as learn a skill,” Vu Ngoc Tu, a 19-year-old ‘mobile’ locksmith explains. “With an experienced and renowned locksmith, clients would come and find him but as a starter, I have to find my clients.”</p>\r\n<p>Tu has followed this job for 4 years since finishing high school. He learned the skills from his uncle who has a stand on Nguyen Cong Tru street. “I want to set up my own stand and buy some machines so now I am saving money. Nowadays, few young people take locksmithery as a career but I think as society develops, people will still need us."</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:24', '2010-12-26 10:24:24'),

Located on a granite knoll on the northern bank of the Cai river in Vinh Phuoc quarter, the Cham Towers of Po Nagar (The Lady of the City) were built between the 7th and 12th centuries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKnown as Thap Ba in Vietnamese, the site included eight towers, four of which remain, which were used for worship as early as the second century AD. Today, ethnic Cham, Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhists come to Po Nagar to pray and make offerings here, according to their respective traditions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original wooden structure was razed to the ground by an invading troop of Javanese in 744 AD but was replaced by a stone and brick temple in 784.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most sacred, and highest, tower is the 28-metre North Tower, with its terraced pyramid roof, vaulted interior masonry and vestibule. A superb example of Cham architecture, it was built in 817AD by Pangro, a minister of King Harivaman I, after the original temples here were sacked and burned by raiders, who made off with whatever precious metal they could find.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 918 AD, King Harivaman III placed a gold mukha-linga in this tower, but it was also stolen, this time by Khmer soldiers. In 965 AD, King Jaya Indravarman I replaced the gold mukha-linga with the stone figure, Uma – a feminine manifestation of Shiva, which remains to this day. In the tower’s main chamber, there is a black stone statute of the goddess Uma with 10 arms, two of which are hidden under her vest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Stony faces...</strong></p>\r\n<p>Situated near the tower complex, Hon Chong is a narrow granite headland that juts out towards the turquoise waters of Nha Trang bay. To the northwest is Nui Co Tien (Fairy Mountain) with three summits believed to resemble a reclining female fairy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a gargantuan handprint-shaped indentation on one massive boulder balanced at the tip of the Hon Chong (Husband Rock). Legend has it that one day a giant was here spying on a female fairy bathing nude at Bai Tien (Fairy Beach) nearby.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe two began a life together, but the Gods soon intervened and punished the giant for his initial cheekiness, sending him off to a “re-education camp” for an indefinite sentence. The lovesick fairy patiently waited for her husband to return.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut after a very long time, despairing that he might never return, she lay down in sorrow and turned into Nui Co Tien. The peak on the right is supposed to be her face, gazing up towards the sky, the middle peak is her bosom and the apex on the left her crossed legs. When the giant returned and saw what had become of his wife, he collapsed in grief next to a boulder, leaving his handprint on it, before turning into stone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext to Hon Chong, there is another rock called Hon Vo (Wife Rock). Locals like to say that this was a female fairy who became ‘petrified’ while waiting for her husband.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Oceanographic Institute</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Nha Trang Oceanographic Institute, founded in 1923, is housed in a French colonial building and home to an aquarium, a library and an exhibition area. Incidentally, the world''s most famous oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau, started his successful career here in 1933 when it was known as ‘Institute d''Océanographique.’<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s well worth checking out the institute to get an insight into the richness of southern Vietnam’s aquaculture. Vietnam is after all a maritime country with a coastline that stretches for more than 3,260km. The Bien Dong (East Sea) plays an important role in the development of the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exploration for reasonable and sustainable exploitation of resources and protection of the environment in the Bien Dong is the main objective of the institute. The 23 aquarium tanks on the ground floors are home to a variety of live specimens – including some wonderful seahorses. Behind the main buildings, the exhibition area features nearly 70,000 dead specimens and a rather spectacular giant whale’s skeleton.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The good doctor</strong></p>\r\n<p>Alexandre Yersin had a deep and meaningful relationship with Vietnam and the French doctor was in fact buried in Nha Trang on his request. Born in Switzerland, he came to Vietnam in 1889 after working under Louis Pasteur in Paris. He spoke Vietnamese fluently, and spent years travelling throughout the central highlands and recording his observations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this period he discovered what is now Dalat and recommended to the colonical French government that a hill station be established there. Yersin also introduced rubber and quinine-producing trees to Vietnam. Today, the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang coordinates vaccination and hygiene programmes for the country’s southern coastal region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe doctor’s library and office were transformed into the Alexandre Yersin Museum, another one of the town’s cultural attractions. Items on display include laboratory equipment (such as his astronomical instruments), books from his library, a fascinating 3-D photo viewer and some of the thousand or so letters written to his mother. A model boat on display was apparently given to him by local fishermen with whom he spent a great deal of his time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo doubt Dr Yersin also liked the feel of the sand between his toes and the sea breeze blowing through his hair – and after a day of sight-seeing, the sun has gone down far enough for me to hit the beach, too.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:24', '2010-12-26 10:24:24'),

These are the things that will attract foreign visitors most, and if properly developed, will undoubtedly create many job opportunities for the local people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two forms of business in RT. One is on the environmental aspect (recycling rubbish, developing systems to save energy, electricity and water, instructing visitors to protect the environment and buy "environmentally-friendly" products). The other is on the socio-economic aspect (recruiting and providing training for needy locals, issuing policies on food and goods purchased by visitors, involving local people in guiding services, carrying and transporting).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Le Hoang Viet, from the Energy Conservation Research and Development Centre mentioned, "If hotel businesses can pay more attention to energy-saving matters in areas such as the hotel lobby, rooms, kitchen, restaurants, washing and ironing services, entertainment and massage services, a huge amount of costs will be saved."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne example that has proved to be practical is the "Company doing business with needy people" model at Huyen Tran Culture Centre (Hue City). This model has created job opportunities for about 70 needy people. Among those 50 were trained as service staff (guides, security, cleaning and gardening staff), 15 trained to perform handicraft arts (making Vietnamese hats, frankincense and wooden items), and 5 trained to write calligraphy and practice meditation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe model has had a direct impact on generating income for the local labour force, and increasing income (at least by 15%) for about 500 handicraft production households in the neighbouring areas (as main source of supply for the Culture Centre). This will ensure the recovery and conservation of these traditional villages as well as tourism products, thus stablising this new market. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Nepal, the project was a success with about 70 responsible tourism activities created. Thousands of needy people were employed and their income significantly improved as a result.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Vietnam, the homestay tourism service model has been tested and applied in Sapa (Lao Cai), Cu Lao Cham (Quang Nam), Phuoc Tich Village (Hue), and Chay Lap Hamlet (Quang Binh). Eco-tourism has been used in Ha Long Bay (Quang Ninh), Can Gio Mangrove Forest (HCMC), and Tra Que Vegetable Village (Hoi An). This movement has opened up numerous positive directions for both businesses and local people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter surveying 5 main tourism locations in Vietnam, (Hanoi, HCMC, Hoi An, Ha Long and Hue), Mr. Phil Harman, Senior Advisor of the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) in Vietnam said, "Visitors are now becoming more aware and concerned about other matters relating to tourism such as littering rubbish in public places, water and noise pollution. 97 percent of tourists, when interviewed, said that they were willing to pay more for a responsible travel holiday that is environmentally conscious and brings about more benefits for needy local people. Specifically, international and Vietnamese tourists will contribute respectively USD 47 and USD 27 more for each trip if RT service is included in the tour."<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA great tip in RT: local people''s friendliness is highly valued among tourists. In the survey done by the SNV, Hanoi is the place that visitors are the most displeased with.
